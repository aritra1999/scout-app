In this groundbreaking work of investigative journalism, Judith Miller, Stephen Engelberg, and William Broad of The New York Times uncover the truth about biological weapons and show why bio-warfare and bio-terrorism are fast becoming our worst national nightmare.  Among the startling revelations in Germs:   How the CIA secretly built and tested a model of a Soviet-designed germ bomb, alarming some officials who felt the work pushed to the limits of what is permitted by the global treaty banning germ arms. How the Pentagon embarked on a secret effort to make a superbug. Details about the Soviet Union's massive hidden program to produce biological weapons, including new charges that germs were tested on humans. How Moscow's scientists made an untraceable germ that instructs the body to destroy itself. The Pentagon's chaotic efforts to improvise defenses against Iraq's biological weapons during the 1991 Persian Gulf War. How a religious cult in Oregon in the 1980s sickened hundreds of Americans in a bio-terrorism attack that the government played down to avoid panic and copycat strikes. Plans by the U.S. military in the 1960s to attack Cuba with germ weapons.   Germs also shows how a small group of scientists and senior officials persuaded President Bill Clinton to launch a controversial multibillion-dollar program to detect a germ attack on U.S. soil and to aid its victims -- a program that, so far, is struggling to provide real protection.  Based on hundreds of interviews with scientists and senior officials, including President Clinton, as well as on recently declassified documents and on-site reporting from the former Soviet Union's sinister bio-weapons labs, Germs shows us bio-warriors past and present at work at their trade. There is the American scientist who devoted his professional life to perfecting biological weapons, and the Nobel laureate who helped pioneer the new biology of genetically modified germs and is now trying to stop its misuse. We meet former Soviet scientists who made enough plague, smallpox, and anthrax to kill everyone on Earth and whose expertise is now in great demand by terrorists, rogue states, and legitimate research labs alike.  A frightening and unforgettable narrative of cutting-edge science and spycraft, Germs shows us why advances in biology and the spread of germ weapons expertise to such countries as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea could make germs the weapon of the twenty-first century.", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster"}, {"id": "4e1ad87e-c4cf-4b8a-8968-02f6d67c8720", "title": "The Good Book: Reading the Bible with Mind and Heart", "authors": ["By Gomes, Peter J."], "year": "1998", "description": "\"The Bible and the social and moral consequences that derive from its interpretation are all too important to be left in the hands of the pious or the experts, and too significant to be ignored and trivialized by the uninformed and indifferent.", "publisher": "Harper Perennial"}, {"id": "7ba35975-cd2e-4163-858c-2e6e57ed22d0", "title": "All over but the Shoutin'", "authors": ["By Bragg, Rick"], "year": "1998", "description": "A New York Times Notable Book of the YearThis haunting, harrowing, gloriously moving recollection of a life on the American margin is the story of Rick Bragg, who grew up dirt-poor in northeastern Alabama, seemingly destined for either the cotton mills or the penitentiary, and instead became a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter for The New York Times. It is the story of Bragg's father, a hard-drinking man with a murderous temper and the habit of running out on the people who needed him most.But at the center of this soaring memoir is Bragg's mother, who went eighteen years without a new dress so that her sons could have school clothes and picked other people's cotton so that her children wouldn't have to live on welfare alone.

The mind-boggling scope of the abuse of perks and privilege by both legislators and their staffers finally shocked him into reality.What began as a secret journal for his children to clear his conscience has become Hill Rat, a journey behind Congress' closed doors and into the corrupt back alleys of power. With both humor and outrage, Jackley reveals how the promise of Congress has been hijacked and corrupted by the current crop of careerist incumbents. \"Today,\" he writes, \"a successful congressman has the fundraising ability of a hooker trying to make cab fare home and the morals of a big-time football coach!\"His account is laced with the names of Capitol Hill's most prominent legislators--Majority Leader Richard Gephardt, Speaker of the House Thomas Foley, Ron Dellums, Bill Alexander, Minority Whip Newt Gingrich, Thomas Luken, and scores of others.

In 1990, the first post-Jim Wright, post-congressional scandal election, 96% of the incumbents who ran were reelected.

It changed my life - or almost did - and I think about it more than I should, but that was a long time ago.Amid the breathtaking beauty of the Catskill Mountains, Avrum Feldman listened to the haunting voice of Amelita Galli-Curci ringing over the Shandaken Valley - a voice no one else could hear. When he died at age one hundred six, his obsession for the famous opera diva had lasted three-quarters of a century. Most people considered Avrum crazy, someone preoccupied with romantic nonsense. But Madison Lee \"Bobo\" Murphy was not among them, for he, too, had a love that changed his life, or almost did: Amy Lourie.In the summer of 1955, Bobo was a waiter at the Catskill's Pine Hill Inn; a rural Southerner who had never heard the word meshugge until Avrum - a retired furrier, teacher, and translator from New York City - became his unlikely friend. For Bobo nothing about that summer ever lost its glow: his first taste of kartoffel suppe; the exotic mingling of Yiddish and German in the dining room; the girl he met and loved....In everyone's life, Avrum had instructed, there is one grand, undeniable moment of change that never stops mattering. It came for Bobo in his first meeting with Amy, the most beautiful girl he had ever seen. He was too naive to comprehend the gulf between their worlds, and she was too smitten by him to care. But for a wealthy Jewish girl and a Georgia farm boy, the summer had to end, leaving Bobo to learn the painful lesson of loving someone and believing you cannot be with them.Now, thirty-eight years later, Avrum is gone, leaving a will that beckons Bobo north to the Catskills once more. In the places he'd walked so often on the paths of memory, he embraces the ghosts of old friendships and the haunting hints of Amy's presence, until she unexpectedly appears. Nothing has dimmed the passion of their youth, yet two lifetimes and a thousand Catskills sunsets stand between who they were and who they have become. The strikes against them are different now, but mysteriously, miraculously, as Bobo carries out Avrum's last wishes for a strange Kaddish, he hears the dreams of his youth, of the young man who went forth and became part of a love larger than himself....", "publisher": "Atria Books"}, {"id": "67dd30d7-3aa8-4f8c-bf5f-9af75a1703c5", "title": "Codebreakers' Victory: How the Allied Cryptogaphers Won World War II", "authors": ["By Haufler, Hervie"], "year": "2003", "description": "For the first time ever, veteran World War II cryptographer Hervie Haufler details how American and British codebreakers were the decisive factor in the Allied victory.

In an accessible account based on years of research, interviews and exclusive access to previously top-secret archives, Haufler demonstrates how cryptography enabled Nimitz and MacArthur to persevere in the Pacific and helped Eisenhower and Patton mount the assaults on Normandy.

Harold Kushner, writing with his customary generosity and wisdom, shows us how human life is too complex for anyone to live it without making mistakes, and why we need not fear the loss of God's love when we are less than perfect. Harold Kushner begins by offering a radically new interpretation of the story of Adam and Eve, which he sees as a tale of Paradise Outgrown rather than Paradise Lost: eating from the Tree of Knowledge was not an act of disobedience, but a brave step forward toward becoming human, complete with the richness of work, sexuality and child-rearing, and a sense of our mortality. Drawing on modern literature, psychology, theology,,and his own thirty years of experience as a congregational rabbi, Harold Kushner reveals how acceptance and forgiveness can change our relationships with the most important people in our lives and help us meet the bold and rewarding challenge of being human.", "publisher": "Back Bay Books"}, {"id": "e5c13682-6ee6-472c-9539-4bbe16badeac", "title": "Written by Herself: Autobiographies of American Women: An Anthology", "authors": ["By Conway, Jill Ker (EDT)"], "year": "1992", "description": "The bestselling author of The Road from Coorain presents an extraordinarily powerful anthology of the autobiographical writings of 25 women, literary predecessors and contemporaries that include Jane Addams, Zora Neale Hurst, Harriet Jacobs, Ellen Glasgow, Maya Angelou, Sara Josephine Baker, Margaret Mead, Gloria Steinem, and Maxine Hong Kingston.", "publisher": "Vintage"}, {"id": "f692ff1b-e245-47f3-a9f2-a2fbf83d58c3", "title": "George Meany And His Times: A Biography", "authors": ["By Robinson, Archie"], "year": "1982", "description": "Draws on interviews and unpublished documents to re-create the life and times of the outspoken and influential labor leader and the drama of the labor movement in which he played a central role", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster"}, {"id": "dea61187-b7bc-4c51-9072-75716b461015", "title": "American Dreams: Lost & Found", "authors": ["By Terkel, Studs"], "year": "1980", "description": "A cross-section of Americans--from an embittered Miss America to Arnold Schwarzenegger, from Jesse Helms to a KKK member, from businessmen and Brahmins to activists and immigrants--speak of their hopes, expectations, and disappointments", "publisher": "Pantheon"}, {"id": "d3234519-1410-4b06-be7e-41743c269046", "title": "Love, Love, and Love", "authors": ["By Bernhard, Sandra"], "year": "1993", "description": "Even if you know Sandra Bernhard as an actress, singer, comedian, and performer, you're in for quite a shock with this, her second book.

The same biting wit, fragile irony, and arresting candor of Sandra's performances are all here, but Love Love and Love is also filled with an intimacy and an insight that are all new... and all Bernhard.Here are the stories of a relationship built on the weapon of romance; of an elusive girl, and the various drugs she gives and takes; of dreams and daydreams that melt into truth; of the touch of a lover's skin at the break of dawn; and of all the pain and cruelty that go along so well with the ecstasy we all want to possess. This is a book about relationships born of chance meetings on the street at night; about sexual obsessions, frayed emotions, and haunting memories of both the quick and the dead. Love Love and Love is by turns shocking and exhilarating, angry and passionate, analytical and sexy; it's all about that strange state of being that merges sensations only of the moment with an emotion that has existed since the birth of humankind.As Sandra herself notes: \"Love is the only shocking act left on the face of the earth.\"", "publisher": "HarperCollins"}, {"id": "c210698f-0ea1-4c60-a0a5-4ad3e1002d12", "title": "Conflicting Accounts: The Creation and Crash of the Saatchi and Saatchi Advertising Empire", "authors": ["By Goldman, Kevin"], "year": "1998", "description": "On December 16, 1994, a bloodletting took place in the stylish sixth-floor boardroom at Saatchi & Saatchi Company PLC, once the world's largest advertising agency holding company. Maurice Saatchi, the 48 year-old chairman who co-founded the company in 1970 with his older brother Charles, was fired by the board of directors under threat by the firm's largest shareholders. Less than a month later, Maurice started a rival ad agency and quickly snapped up former Saatchi & Saatchi clients, most importantly British Airways. Kevin Goldman, the former daily advertising columnist for the Wall Street Journal, spoke to everyone connected with this headline-making saga -- including Maurice Saatchi and his reclusive brother Charles -- and witnessed important business meetings, including Maurice Saatchi's winning pitch to British Airways. Goldman traces every step the Saatchi brothers took, from their youth as Iraqi Jewish immigrants in North London to their business merger in 1970, when, with little more than sheer audacity, the opened an ad agency with a full-page announcement ad in the London Sunday Times. Through bold and brash actions, the agency began an acquisitions binge, taking over many of the ad industry's giants -- including Ted Bates, Backer & Spielvogel, Dancer Fitzgerald Sample, and Garland-Compton -- to become the number one ad company in the world. But, once they acquired a company, the brothers lost interest, often refusing to meet with its executives again. This disdain would come back to haunt them. Also chronicled is the brothers' rich lifestyle, which critics claim was funded by the company. This tale features a rich cast of supporting players: Jeremy Sinclair, a creative advertising genius who was fiercely loyal to the brothers, was one of the executives who resigned after Maurice was fired. Bill Muirhead, another loyalist, was responsible for keeping clients happy. Robert Louis-Dreyfus, a globe-trotting native of France, was brought in by the Saatchis in 1989 when the company was teetering on the edge of bankruptcy. Louis-Dreyfus brought in Charles Scott, a self-described numbers cruncher uncomfortable with the glitzy world of advertising, to help sort out the company's complex finances. And leading the anti-Maurice movement was David Herro, a thirty-three-year-old American money manager whose group owned approximately 10 percent of Saatchi stock. Built into the Saatchi story is the bigger picture of the dramatic changes in advertising in the 1980s, such as the merger mania and ad agency consolidations that swept Madison Avenue, including the British takeover of major agencies. The story of the decline and crash of Saatchi & Saatchi is a universal tale of corporate greed and ineffective management. It is the story of an ugly, publicly fought civil war in an industry that is supposed to know the steep price paid for an image run amok.", "publisher": "Touchstone"}, {"id": "88f08d93-2060-45c1-9e55-3dff63a67ed1", "title": "Panic Disorder and Its Treatment (Medical Psychiatry Series)", "authors": ["By Pollack, Mark H.

Continuing to chart the impact of the Technology Adoption Life Cycle, he explores its effects not just on marketing but on overall business planning, especially strategic partnerships, competitive advantage, positioning and organizational leadership. Moore's most startling lesson is: \"As markets move from stage to stage in the Life Cycle, the winning strategy does not just change -- it actually reverses the prior strategy. The very skills that you've just perfected become your biggest liabilities; and if you can't put them aside to acquire new ones, then you're in for tough times.\" As challenging as this lesson is to apply, Moore leads the way. Using actual examples of cutting-edge firms, he applies the Life Cycle model to all aspects of managing a market-focused business strategy, including how to manage people effectively through each phase of the cycle. There are significant management implications: Chasm-crossers who love the customer intimacy of niches may rebel against the depersonalizing power of the tornado; tornado managers who relish the gales of hyper-growth may resist the inevitable return to the niche, in the guise of mass customization, once the rush to the new paradigm subsides. All industries relying on technology -- not just computer hardware, software and telecommunications, but entertainment, publishing, broadcasting, banking, insurance, health care, aerospace, defense, utilities, pharmaceuticals and retail -- must master Moore's lessons to see the year 2000.

Homes's pursuit of this malignant and cunning villain presents the great man \"with the most remarkable case of his celebrated career.\"In Minnesota, Holmes comes face-to-face with all manner of frontier characters, including two-fisted railroad men, rough-and-tumble lumberjacks, a one-eyed teamster, and an unsavory town marshal. But he also encounters the proprietress of the North Woods' most opulent sporting house, Mary Robinson, a woman as clever as she is beautiful. In response to a churlish remark from Dr. Watson about the morality of her establishment, she replies: \"Morality is a matter of power, nothing more and nothing less. The rich impose it on the poor, men impose it on women, and the forces of reaction impose it upon those who seek a better world.\"Needless to say, Holmes becomes especially attentive to this suspect's articulate charm. But charm gives way to terror in the exciting climax of the tale, a chase on the rails that ends with Holmes and the Red Demon squared off on a lonely bridge in a fiery circle of death. \"Never,\" says Watson, \"was Holmes more magnificent than at that moment.\"", "publisher": "Viking"}, {"id": "e2f150a9-3409-430d-be44-ede9819cf976", "title": "New Lands, New Men", "authors": ["By Goetzmann, William H."], "year": "1986", "description": "Examines the adventures of the explorers during the seventeenth through the nineteenth centuries and shows how the impetus to explore transcended national interests and imperialist ambitions", "publisher": "Viking Adult"}, {"id": "0b03aa4d-65ee-4b24-83b9-74fc527257ae", "title": "Reinventing Government: How the Entrepreneurial Spirit is Transforming the Public Sector (Plume)", "authors": ["By Osborne, David and Gaebler, Ted"], "year": "1993", "description": "Describes how decentralization and entrepreneurship can revitalize government and outlines ten principles guiding an entrepreneurial public organization", "publisher": "Plume"}, {"id": "f4c4b58b-1492-477a-8023-df38f031f87d", "title": "Proverbs For The People", "authors": ["By Price-Thompson, Tracy (EDT) and Stovall, Taressa (EDT)"], "year": "2003", "description": "Featuring contributions from such noted writers as Pearl Cleage, Omar Tyree, Timmothy McCann, and Earl Sewell, a dramatically rendered anthology of stories, drawn from African, African-American, and Biblical proverbs, is filled with an abundance of wit, inspiration, and wisdom.", "publisher": "Kensington"}, {"id": "ef7a0fc6-cf1b-45a9-a3f8-73a5edeb79ab", "title": "Re-Inventing the Corporation: Transforming Your Job and Your Company for the New Information Society", "authors": ["By Naisbitt, John and Aburdene, Patricia"], "year": "1985", "description": "Describes how the new information society is altering the nature of the workplace and how some corporations are responding", "publisher": "Little Brown & Co"}, {"id": "99e8110c-ca5f-49fb-8b35-be2fe5f4e87f", "title": "Elvis in the Morning", "authors": ["By Buckley, William F."], "year": "2002", "description": "This is a novel about friendship, a novel that spans the decades that changed America forever.

Where his first,Burnt Water, published in 1980, had as its underlying theme Mexico City itself,Constancia and Other Stories for Virgins extends its imaginative boundaries out to Savannah, to Cadiz, to Glasgow, to Seville and Madrid, both past and present. This new collection is more mysterious, more magical, too, than its predecessor, and in its five related stories Fuentes comes closer to the registers of language and feeling that he explored so memorably inAura. It reveals Fuentes at the height of his powers--bold, erudite, enthralling.In the title story, a man discovers his wife's secret complicity with the Russian actor who is their neighbor--a complicity that includes not just a previous life but possibly a previous death as well. He finds himself \"a mediator . . . a point between one sorrow and the next, between one hope and the next, between two languages, two memories, two ages, and two deaths.\" In \"La Desdichada,\" two students steal--and fall in love with--a store-window mannequin. In \"The Prisoner of Las Lomas,\" a wealthy lawyer in possession of a powerful secret is held hostage by the past he has attempted to subvert and keep at bay. The celebrated bullfighter whose fame is the theme of \"Viva Mi Fama\" steps from the present into a past immortalized by Goya's portrait of the matador Pedro Romero; and the architects who are the \"Reasonable People\" of that story find themselves drawn into the irrational mysteries not only of religious fervor but of their famous mentor's identity--they discover \"there are no empty houses,\" only a present fraught with the past.Though each of these novella-length stories offers compelling evidence of Fuentes's talent for narrative free rein as well as for containment and closure, they are also brilliantly interwoven. Readers of his earlier work, especially of his acclaimed ribald epic, Christopher Unborn, will recognize with pleasure Fuentes's undiminished mastery of recurrent images and themes, and all readers will delight in the witty and evocative changes he rings on them. For those few readers who do not yet know the work of Mexico's foremost man of letters, these stories offer them the full gift of his imaginative resourcefulness.", "publisher": "Farrar, Straus and Giroux"}, {"id": "9ce47ad5-7155-49dc-9a6d-263c1797b6fb", "title": "Listening to Prozac: A Psychiatrist Explores Antidepressant Drugs and the Remaking of the Self", "authors": ["By Kramer, Peter D."], "year": "1993", "description": "Kramer (psychiatry, Brown U.) writes on \"the capacity of modern medication to allow a person to experience, on a stable and continuing basis, the feelings of someone with a different temperament and history,\" as \"one born with a different genome and exposed to a more benign world in childhood\"--p.195.

In French and Japanese, Hebrew and English, executives are asking, \"How can I survive and thrive in the borderless, global marketplace?\"  For answers, the authors of Global Literacies went straight to the leaders themselves -- the CEOs of thousands of corporations around the globe.  Two lessons emerged. First, there are leadership universals that every executive and manager needs to practice in order to be world-class at home and abroad. The second defied conventional wisdom: in the borderless economy, culture doesn't matter less, it matters more.  Around the world, business leaders apply their own experiences -- personal, professional, and cultural -- to an ever-expanding world of Dutch colleagues, Brazilian suppliers, Taiwanese manufacturers, and Chinese competitors. These leaders are trying to become globally literate...and Global Literacies is for, and about, them.  No one knows this better than CEOs of successful global companies such as Japan's Canon, Sweden's Ericsson, Taiwan's Acer Computers, the U.K.'s British Telecommunications, and U.S.-based Coca-Cola.  In Global Literacies, a team of researchers led by Robert Rosen, Ph.D., of Healthy Companies International, and Watson Wyatt Worldwide have produced the first model of international business success based on a wide-ranging landmark study of global leaders and their world-class companies. Global Literacies documents the exclusive results of a worldwide survey of over one thousand senior executives and in-depth interviews with CEOs of seventy-eight companies -- companies representing 3.5 million employees in more than 200 countries, and with more than $725 billion in annual sales.  Global Literacies offers compelling new insights and business tools:  The Global Leadership Universals  Learn the new literacies of business:  * Personal Literacy -- understanding and valuing yourself * Social Literacy -- engaging and challenging people * Business Literacy -- focusing and mobilizing your business * Cultural Literacy -- valuing and leveraging cultural difference  The Global Success Quotient  Learn which are the most globally active, financially successful companies -- and countries -- in the world, understand how they got there, and apply those learnings to your own organization.

Since then she's kept her hands full and her mind and heart occupied by running The Sewing Circus, an all-girl group she founded to provide badly needed services like day care and job counseling to young women, many of whom are single mothers. More important, The Circus is a place for lively, wide-ranging, heart-to-heart discussions that will help members grow into what Joyce likes to call \"twenty-first-century free women.\"All in all, Joyce has a full and rich life. She has her work, her family, her friends, and her town. But there are some nights when she crawls into bed alone and has to admit that something is missing. What she doesn't have is that red dress she keeps dreaming about or a social life that would accommodate it even if she braved the mail and bought one. To further complicate matters, she may not have The Sewing Circus much longer, as the state legislature has decided not to fund the group's vital but hard-todefine work with young women who are too often regarded as problems rather than possibilities.Feeling defeated and pessimistic, Joyce reluctantly agrees to keep a date for dinner at the home of her best friend, Sister -- a reverend like no other-and finds not only a perfect meal but a tall, dark stranger named Nate Anderson. Nate has just joined the administration at the high school and his unexpected presence in Idlewild touches a chord in Joyce that she thought her heart had forgotten how to play. Nate feels the same immediate connection, but both have enough experience with broken hearts to take it real slow. Besides, they've got too much work to do to concentrate on falling in love....But life moves at its own pace, and as Sister says, \"if you want to make God laugh, make plans.\" Particularly when it comes to matters of the heart. Joyce decides the trick is to stay focused and to remember that nothing is as sexy as the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, especially if you tell it while you're wearing a perfect red dress....", "publisher": "William Morrow"}, {"id": "13bac4d4-63dc-4aef-b05f-8f5a8f7bf9cf", "title": "The Visitation", "authors": ["By Reidy, Sue"], "year": "1997", "description": "The Flynn girls, just two of a seemingly endless number of Flynn children, are naturally curious about where their little siblings come from.

This vitality, fleshed out with deep research and attired in elegant style, has drawn countless readers to subjects otherwise approachable only by experts. Through eight books, from the story of the early eighteenth century Manchu bondservant Ts'ao Yin to his magisterial history, The Search for Modern China, Spence has made the excitement of intellectual discovery palpable for us all. In the course of his fruitful career Spence has written many shorter pieces as well, and the best of these are collected for the first time in Chinese Roundabout. Here the reader will meet Arcadio Huang, the Chinese linguist and Christian convert who moves from south China to Enlightenment Paris, marries a French woman, and in conversations with Montesquieu becomes the likely source for the Persian Letters. The poignant story of Huang's hard-won success and final defeat by poverty and disease illustrates the perils of crossing cultures. Spence's delight in intellectual risk animates his Shakespearean approach to the life of the great Qing emperor in \"The Seven Ages of K'ang-hsi.\" Spence's great learning informs an authoritative essay on China's tragic experience with opium. Following the social process of addiction from the cultivation of poppies and the processing of the drug through its introduction by the British into China, its widespread distribution and consumption by Chinese, and the public struggle to suppress opium use, Spence explores issues of historical and contemporary interest. In an equally substantial piece he focuses on the cultural dimensions of food in Qing China, illuminating the marginal diet of a peasantry constantly threatened by famine as well as the grand banquets of the literati and the imperial household. In the work of 25 years, Spence has established himself as a brilliant interpreter of modern Chinese history. His booksâamong them the recent national bestseller The Search for Modern Chinaâexhibit uncommon imagination, unobtrusive learning, verve, and elegance. These same qualities animate the essays gathered here.", "publisher": "W. W.

She discovered in many such people a specific form of narcissistic character resistance which she terms deployment. Deployment is a vigilant use of the balances of interpersonal power designed to ward off intolerable feelings, predominantly of envy, shame, and guilt. Patients who use deployment put themselves in the role of the victim and then battle against perceived injustice, abuse, and oppression for the right to be understood and accepted. Such patients often expect the therapist to take responsibility for their suffering.In addition to exploring deployment as a kind of self organization, Dr. Moses-Hrushovski details her formulation of treatment approaches that enable her to build bridges to these patients and help them uncover and live with the feeling states that they are desperately trying to ward off.", "publisher": "Jason Aronson, Inc."}, {"id": "f4e14323-98a9-425b-bbc2-34101ac8424f", "title": "The Final Days", "authors": ["By Bernstein, Carl and Woodward, Bob"], "year": "1976", "description": "The Final Days is the classic, behind-the-scenes account of Richard Nixon's dramatic last months as president.

And they couldn't help themselves, they say.In this provocative and important collection of essays, Dershowitz reviews a wide range of recent cases - including those of O. J.

In addition to examining details of behavior, Dr Morris considers such questions as why horseshoes bring good luck, why we donât eat horses, why jockeys are allowed to whip their mounts and why we call a bad dream a nightmare.And for punters everywhere, he applies his zoological mind to the all-important question of why some horses run faster than othersâ¦", "publisher": "Crown"}, {"id": "0db61feb-9184-47ff-8420-0e6164c8c7f6", "title": "Linda Mccartney's Home Cooking", "authors": ["By McCartney, Linda"], "year": "1992", "description": "Presents a collection of meatless recipes aimed at meat lovers, including beefless stroganoff, moussaka without lamb, shepherd's pie, and other treats", "publisher": "Arcade Publishing"}, {"id": "a96c745d-c8c6-4ceb-8c22-9fc998f23fa4", "title": "Ghost Light: A Memoir", "authors": ["By Rich, Frank"], "year": "2001", "description": "There is a superstition that if an emptied theater is ever left completely dark, a ghost will take up residence.

When Rich was seven years old, his parents separated--at a time when divorce was still tantamount to scandal--and thereafter he and his younger sister were labeled \"children from a broken home.\" Bouncing from school to school and increasingly lonely, Rich became terrified of the dark and the uncertainty of his future. But there was one thing in his life that made him sublimely happy: the Broadway theater.Rich's parents were avid theatergoers, and in happier times they would listen to the brand-new recordings of South Pacific, Damn Yankees, and The Pajama Game over and over in their living room. When his mother's remarriage brought about turbulent changes, Rich took refuge in these same records, re-creating the shows in his imagination, scene by scene. He started collecting Playbills, studied fanatically the theater listings in The New York Times and Variety, and cut out ads to create his own miniature marquees. He never imagined that one day he would be the Times's chief theater critic.Eventually Rich found a second home at Wash-ington's National Theatre, where as a teenager he was a ticket-taker and was introduced not only to the backstage magic he had dreamed of for so long but to a real-life cast of charismatic and eccentric players who would become his mentors and friends. With humor and eloquence, Rich tells the triumphant story of how the aspirations of a stagestruck young boy became a lifeline, propelling him toward the itinerant family of theater, whose romantic denizens welcomed him into the colorful fringes of Broadway during its last glamorous era.Every once in a while, a grand spectacle comes along that introduces its audiences to characters and scenes that will resound in their memories long after the curtain has gone down.Ghost Light, Frank Rich's beautifully crafted childhood memoir, is just such an event.", "publisher": "Random House Trade Paperbacks"}, {"id": "aa639b53-05cd-49fa-be39-8d58569575e7", "title": "The Sands of Time: A Hermux Tantamoq Adventure", "authors": ["By Hoeye, Michael"], "year": "2002", "description": "Our favorite mouse and watchmaker, Hermux Tantamoq, is up to his ears in trouble again.

After all, something inside her is telling her to get back to the desert ranch - why else would she be cooking spicy Mexican meatball soup at her cottage in Maine, when clam chowder should be on the menu?But along with the excitement she feels at going home is an inexplicable sense of foreboding, which is tragically realized once she arrives in Tucson. The ranch manager and his granddaughter are missing from Las Palomas and feared dead. A cryptic note written by one of them containing initials and a meeting time is the only clue that leads Mrs. Potter to suspect foul play. But why would anyone want to harm her old friends? And where could they have disappeared to?When a guest at a dinner gathering thrown by Mrs. Potter winds up dead - apparently from eating her own famous 27-ingredient chili - Mrs. Potter knows she must get involved in solving the crimes before the murderer strikes again.In the midst of these disturbing goings-on, an old love from Eugenia's past arrives on the scene to spice up the danger with a bit of romance.

His memoir of what he found, A Walk Across America, captured the hearts of millions of Americans.Now, Peter is a bit older, married with a family, and his journeys are different than they were. Perhaps he is looking for adventure, perhaps inspiration, perhaps new communities, perhaps unspoiled land.  Certainly, he found all of this and more in Alaska, America's last wilderness.Looking for Alaska is Peter's account of eighteen months spent traveling over twenty thousand miles in tiny bush planes, on snow machines and snowshoes, in fishing boats and kayaks, on the Alaska Marine Highway and the Haul Road, searching for what defines Alaska. Hearing the amazing stories of many real Alaskans--from Barrow to Craig, Seward to Deering, and everywhere in between--Peter gets to know this place in the way that only he can. His resulting portrait is a rare and unforgettable depiction of a dangerous and beautiful land and all the people that call it home.  He also took his wife and eight-year-old daughter with him, settling into a \"home base\" in Seward on the Kenai Peninsula, coming and going from there, and hosting the rest of their family for extended visits. The way his family lived, how they made Alaska their home and even participated in Peter's explorations, is as much a part of this story as Peter's own travels.All in all, Jenkins delivers a warm, funny, awe-inspiring, and memorable diary of discovery-both of this place that captures all of our imaginations, and of himself, all over again.", "publisher": "St. Martin's Press"}, {"id": "867bc574-a4d1-416f-9af5-a8cf27fbc235", "title": "Give Us This Day", "authors": ["By Tudor, Tasha (ILT)"], "year": "1987", "description": "Presents the text of the most widely known version of the Lord's prayer, with illustrations and brief commentary on the prayer's origins and different versions.", "publisher": "Philomel"}, {"id": "0cfea62e-b6c3-4440-ba6a-4498193e9bc8", "title": "Crossing Over Jordan", "authors": ["By Brown, Linda Beatrice"], "year": "1995", "description": "Georgia McCloud lives to see emancipation.

Now he shows himself as much a master of the story as he is of the novel, in a volume that presents fifty stories, including two early collections - The Names and Faces of Heroes and Permanent Errors - as well as more than two dozen new stories that have never been gathered together before.In his introduction, Mr. Price explains how, after the publication of his first two collections, he wrote no new stories for almost twenty years. \"But once I needed - for unknown reasons in a new and radically altered life - to return to the story, it opened before me like a new chance...A collection like this then,\" he adds, \"...will show a writer's pre-occupations in ways the novel severely rations (novels are partly made for that purpose - the release from self, long flights through the Other). John Keats's assertion that 'the excellence of every Art is its intensity' has served as a license and standard for me. From the start my stories were driven by heat - passion and mystery, often passion for the mystery I've found in particular rooms and spaces and the people they threaten or shelter - and my general aim is the transfer of a spell of keen witness, perceived by the reader as warranted in character and act.\"There is, indeed, much for the reader to \"witness\" here of passion and mystery, of character and act. And the variety of stories - many of them set in Reynolds Price's native North Carolina, but a surprising number set in distant parts: Jerusalem in \"An Early Christmas,\" the American Southwest in \"Walking Lessons,\" and a number in Europe - will astonish even his most devoted readers.

She explores the volatility of the region and concludes that it is as unstable now as before. Most significantly, she looks at the war not just from a U.S. perspective, but from the point of view of Kuwait, Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and Syria.Lines in the Sand is dramatic war reporting at its best, by a top female journalist covering the first war in which the American military put women on the frontlines--and, ironically, from a place in which women aren't even allowed to drive.", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster"}, {"id": "3a983738-595d-48c5-aef6-a3a9303d5409", "title": "The Witling", "authors": ["By Vinge, Vernor"], "year": "1986", "description": "This second novel by multiple award-winner Vernor Vinge, from 1976, is a fast-paced adventure where galactic policies collide and different cultures clash as two scientists and their faith in technology are pitted against an elusive race of telekinetic beings.Â Marooned on a distant world and slowly dying of food poisoning, two anthropologists are caught between warring alien factions engaged in a battle that will affect the future of the world's inhabitants and their deadly telekinetic powers.

The development of this school was largely due to Mme. Vaganova (1879â1951), not only a great dancer but also the teacher of Galina Ulanova and many others and an unsurpassed theoretician.The principles of Vaganova's system are presented in this well-known book. Mme. Vaganova's aim of creating a personal approach to the Russian dance was based on the critical assimilation of the experience of her contemporaries. Her ability to choose the best of what had been accomplished in the various ballet traditions (French, Italian, and Russian) and combine these into a unified teaching practice in itself amounted to a new school of dance. She firmly believed that the teaching process should be a planned exercise, ever changing with innovations in the dance. She sought from her pupils emotional expressiveness, strictness of form, a resolute, energetic manner of performance, and the understanding of the underlying coordination of movements.Her book discusses all basic principles of ballet, grouping movements by fundamental types. Chapters cover battements, rotary movements of the legs, the arms, poses of the classical dance, connecting and auxiliary movements, jumps, beats, point work, and turns as well as material for a sample lesson. Diagrams show clearly the exact foot, leg, arm, and body positions for the proper execution of many steps and movements. The result is a fundamental theory of dance that offers dancers, teachers, and ballet lovers information often difficult to locate in other books. 118 illustrations.", "publisher": "Dover Publications"}, {"id": "2cc70557-5e41-4eed-9efd-259ab1422e75", "title": "The Biblical Road to Blessing", "authors": ["By Hinn, Benny"], "year": "1996", "description": "El inalterable amor de Dios y su deseo de bendecir a sus hijos que le obedecen.", "publisher": "Thomas Nelson Inc"}, {"id": "a796ffb6-a532-42b9-9170-1a916c18a69e", "title": "Peanuts: A Golden Celebration: The Art and the Story of the World's Best-Loved Comic Strip", "authors": ["By Schulz, Charles M. and Larkin, David (EDT)"], "year": "1999", "description": "Will Charlie Brown ever get to kick the footballs?

With its fly-on-the-wall voyeurism and remarkable insight, Pledged paints a sharp-eyed portrait of the intriguing and paradoxical world of modern-day sororities.", "publisher": "Hachette Books"}, {"id": "50ea7a9e-4979-4bd4-8dca-76783461eeee", "title": "Guide to Cults and New Religions", "authors": ["By Enroth, Ronald"], "year": "1983", "description": "Discusses the history, beliefs, and practices of the Baha'i, Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh, est, Hare Krishnas, Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons, Unification Church, and other modern cults", "publisher": "Intervarsity Pr"}, {"id": "39f4c199-5c56-4f63-b8c0-95e69adf47dc", "title": "Winter Has Lasted Too Long", "authors": ["By Kavanaugh, James J"], "year": "1977", "description": "Our present need to allow feelings to emerge and develop a deeper awareness of the self and others is the poet's major concern", "publisher": "Dutton"}, {"id": "08d2580f-dd9c-4503-810c-cbcc88cdfc63", "title": "Iron Man: The Cal Ripken, Jr. Story", "authors": ["By Rosenfeld, Harvey"], "year": "1995", "description": "Since May 30, 1982, Cal Ripken, Jr., of the Baltimore Orioles hasn't missed a game - a marathon performance during which he has won the 1982 Rookie of the Year Award, two American League MVP awards, an All-Star Game MVP award, two Gold Gloves, and a World Series title.

In an era of big-money sports, strikes, and grandstanding, the hardest-working ballplayer in the world had single-handedly put the \"great\" back in America's greatest game.Now, with the candor and grace that have endeared him to fans, Ripken tells the story of his journey to that moment and beyond.Best of all, Cal takes us inside the brain of one of the game's smartest players. He dissects the dedication to craft it takes to be a shortstop - especially when you're six-foot-four. He takes us through his strategies at the plate and in the field, his attention to the tiniest detail of positioning, or glove selection, or batting stance. It's a private lesson with one of the true masters of the art of playing baseball.Cal Ripken knows what it means to make a commitment, like the one he's made to his hometown and its team for his whole career, and to his own family.

His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the world -- political, social, and cultural -- as he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Left -- the very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attack -- by left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendas -- with potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms.

Every day thousands of lives are altered by these changes. Most managers and employees, however, do not have the experience to effectively work through such transitions. In Managing Transitions, William Bridges provides a clear understanding of what change does to employees and what employees in transition can do to an organization, and he shows how to minimize the distress and disruptions caused by change.Directed at managers and employees in today&#39;s corporations, where change is necessary to revitalize and improve corporate performance, Managing Transitions  addresses the fact that it is people who have to carry out the change. It not only talks about what should be done, but also shows how to do it, giving managers practical ways to bring the people âon board.â Armed with this new information, managers will look at future changes in a new way, no longer feeling anxious and hopeless, but rather looking at opportunities.Everybody talks about âmanaging changeâ and âresistance to change,â but Bridges is the first to talk about what is going on inside the people who have to make the change work. He is the first to provide any real sense of the emotional impact of change and what can be done to keep it from disrupting the entire organization. Bridges&#39;s years of experience helping organizations and individuals successfully take control of change has proven the need for specific, concrete guidelines for dealing with change.  Managing Transitions provides these guidelines.", "publisher": "Da Capo Lifelong Books"}, {"id": "a0ce68e4-4d7a-41c7-982d-95a41e634236", "title": "Mortgaging The Earth: The World Bank, Environmental Impoverishment, and the Crisis of Development", "authors": ["By Rich, Bruce"], "year": "1994", "description": "The World Bank is the single biggest source of finance for international development, and its policies have a critical impact on the future of more than 110 borrowing countries. In this dramatic and lively new critique, Bruce Rich, internationally known expert on the environment and the World Bank, analyzes how the Bank has become a seemingly unstoppable and often destructive environmental and political force.The author chronicles the life-and-death impact of Bank-funded projects around the world: huge dams that have forced the resettlement of millions of the poorest people on earth, road building and jungle colonization schemes in Brazil, Indonesia, and Africa that have left vast deforestation and social conflict in their wake, and much more. Rich also recounts the bold grassroots campaigns of nongovernmental groups seeking alternatives to Bank-style development.Confidential internal Bank documents expose chronic misrepresentations by Bank management to its donor nations and to the public. Rich reveals how senior officials continue to push money into projects with disastrous ecological and human rights consequences, despite early and persistent protests of Bank staff. He shows how repeatedly and without political accountability the Bank has increased its support for regimes that torture and murder their subjects, from Ceaucescu's Romania to Suharto's Indonesia.Mortgaging the Earth explains the so-called pressure to lend that emerges as a leitmotif in the Bank's fifty-year history and shows how this institutional dynamic has taken on a damaging life of its own. Rich traces the history of the Bank, from its inception at Bretton Woods, where it was conceived as a way to funnel reconstruction loans for war-torn Europe, through the surreally top-down tenure of Robert McNamara to the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit. At Rio, governments poured billions of dollars more into the Bank to save our global environment - while the Bank financed new ecological disasters.The World Bank, Rich demonstrates in a provocative history of development from Descartes to Max Weber to Chico Mendes, is a crucible of the goals of the modern age, goals that in the very moment of their worldwide triumph have become problematic. He shows how the Bank's dilemmas mirror our global civilization's crisis of values and gives expert prescription for reform.Mortgaging the Earth makes disturbingly clear why every American should be concerned about the World Bank, as a critical arena where the global politics of technology, development, and the environment are played out on a small planet, one where the stakes are increasingly for keeps.", "publisher": "Beacon Pr"}, {"id": "ed06e225-a086-42ce-8422-e847b81126ef", "title": "Origins Of History", "authors": ["By Butterfield, Herbert"], "year": "1981", "description": "Discusses the origins of history in ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China, tracing its development from the Hebrew Scriptures, the concepts of the Greeks and early Christians, to the birth of modern historical criticism", "publisher": "Basic Books"}, {"id": "8d718361-3b36-4081-a7b8-b608ab206620", "title": "What Bird Did That?: A Driver's Guide to Some Common Birds of North America", "authors": ["By Silver, Burton"], "year": "2004", "description": "An unusual guide to bird droppings identifies more than forty-five different birds, with information on each bird's habitat and food", "publisher": "Ten Speed Press"}, {"id": "b7d28226-eb6b-460b-ae8a-93ca9ed3372e", "title": "Inner Revolution", "authors": ["By Thurman, Robert A.

How did a man earn his living, what did he wear, where did he go in his leisure time? What was the relationship between an ordinary Egyptian and his government, his wife, his children? Was life for him grim or optimistic, difficult or easy, reverent or worldly? Did his people travel, explore, conquer? Were they very much different from those of the other great civilizations of antiquity, the Greek and the Roman? What was the nature of their science, art, magic, religion? If the past has lessons for the present, what can we deduce from ancient Egyptian life that is of value to us today?For generations, scholar, specialists, and general readers have been turning to a monumental sourcebook for the answers to such questions: Life in Ancient Egypt by Adolf Erman. It is one of the most influential and frequently consulted works on Egyptology ever written, a classic in its field and the basis of numerous other studies and works. It is still one of a very few books that offer the modern reader so satisfying, informative, and complete a survey in one volume.Erman, a rigorously trained scholar, Director of the Egyptian Museum in Berlin, and author of standard works on Egyptology, covers his subject thoroughly and with a wealth of interesting, concrete detail. He examines ancient Egyptâs political structure, crime and police systems, domestic life and kinships, dress, amusements, religion, learning, mathematics, magic and folk beliefs, literature, art, agriculture, trades, arts and crafts, commerce, warfare, and much else. His objective point of view, eschewing romanticism on the one hand and frigid pedantry on the other, gives us a treatment that is as trustworthy in fact as it is evocative in effect â as Professor Jon Manchip White says in his new introduction for this edition, âFrom first to last â¦ a superb performance.â The scholar, the student and the merely curious can do no better than to go to this first, great authority on ancient Egypt.

Since early childhood, Price had known Bible stories of patriarchs, kings, prophets, and the boldly assertive women of Ancient Israel, as well as the four-fold gospel story of the life of Jesus -- another Jew whose career has exerted immense fascination on subsequent history.  In Price's early middle age, however, he felt compelled to go further than simple reading; he began to investigate the rudiments of the Bible stories as deeply as possible. He focused on the Hebrew and Greek originals that are unquestionably the most discussed and annotated texts with the close assistance of other literal versions and of numerous scholarly commentaries, old and modern. He was likewise encouraged and helped by frequent discussions with distinguished scholar-colleagues at Duke University, where he has taught since 1958.  As the work continued over several years, Price expanded his translation attempts into the Greek New Testament. And soon he had begun an informal navigation of the shoals of Koine Greek -- that common Mediterranean dialect in which a good deal of the business of the Roman empire was conducted and in which the gospels and all other books of the New Testament were written. Gradually, his translations of separate incidents from the four gospels evolved into a literal translation of the whole of the oldest gospel, Mark. His first version of Mark appeared, along with other translations from the Old and New Testaments, in A Palpable God (Atheneum, 1978). The book met with a wide and favorable reception from scholars, writers, and critics.  Price's studies have expanded steadily in the intervening decades; and in recent years he has worked at both a revised version of his early translation of Mark and an entirely new literal version of the Gospel of John (John is the lastpublished gospel and almost surely the one that comes, at its core, from an eyewitness of the life of Jesus). To his new translations, Price has added extensive prefaces, which he hopes will be of interest to scholars and casual readers alike. The prefaces are the result not only of his own work as a translator and his discussions with New Testament scholars of more than twenty years reading in textual exegesis, in the life of the first-century Roman world (including the immensely complicated realities of Roman Palestine), but also in consideration of thewidespread and ongoing attempt to reconsider the historical bases of our knowledge of Jesus.  Finally, after twice teaching a semester-long seminar on the gospels of Mark and John at Duke University, Price has written a gospel of his own. The new gospel, which he calls \"apocryphal\" in a non-canonical sense, makes a fresh attempt at a compact narrative of the life and work of Jesus. Yet it is an attempt grounded meticulously in the earliest available historic, biographical, and theological evidence. In a third and final preface, Price describes the motive for writing a gospel of his own. In brief, his new gospel (like the whole of Three Gospels) aims to render the highest possible contemporaryjustice to a life lived two thousand years ago, a life presented in -- and, to a startling extent, still recoverable from -- documents that have proved the most influential in Western history.", "publisher": "Scribner"}, {"id": "209372b2-558a-4e4a-83db-5f2824345fed", "title": "Creative Conversations: The Writer's Complete Guide to Conducting Interviews", "authors": ["By Schumacher, Michael"], "year": "1990", "description": "Offers practical advice on preparing for, arranging, and conducting interviews, shows how to use an interviewee's words, and discusses legal and ethical aspects", "publisher": "Writer's Digest Books"}, {"id": "bb666a5c-bf9b-461c-8ff5-aae370e8d5db", "title": "Doing It", "authors": ["By Burgess, Melvin"], "year": "2004", "description": "I mean-I like girls.

By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, \"The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.\"Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, Who Says Elephants Can't Dance? sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey & Co., Inc.

Rather, the whole history of the changing role of art and artists in a democratic, industrial, and technological society stands behind the spate of artists' words and the public's hunger for them?even some of the general public out there beyond art's little circle. Statements by artists appeal somewhat the way drawings do: they bring us, or at least they hold the promise of bringing us, closer to the artist's thoughts and feelings and to an understanding of his or her modus operandi; they hold the keys to a mysterious realm. And sometimes they offer us the sheer pleasure of good reading. Such is the primary raison d'?e of this book.Its other motivation is educational, and stems from the frustrating lack, in teaching contemporary art, of any single compilation of statements by American artists from 1940 to the present.? This anthology differs in several respects from those others that do include documents of American art since 1940.? The selection I have made is devoted exclusively to statements of artists; it is limited to the last four decades; it presents in a single volume a representative and fairly comprehensive coverage of major developments in American art beginning with Abstract Expressionism; and, whenever possible, it cities the first, or among the very earliest, documents signalizing a shift in the definition, intent, or direction of art.?", "publisher": "Routledge"}, {"id": "c4942e30-f8e6-4656-a149-8525d5fdfe98", "title": "The Princess Test (Princess Tales)", "authors": ["By Andersen, Hans Christian, Levine, Gail Carson, Elliott, Mark (ILT), and Elliott, Mark"], "year": "1999", "description": "Gail Carson Levine charmed the world with Ella Enchanted, her spirited retelling of the Cinderella story.

In short, we've forgotten how to fall in love.But help is on the way. In Why Can't I Pall in Love? Shmuley Boteach, author of the international bestseller Kosher Sex, offers hope for anyone who wonders why love is so hard to find. Bringing love into your life, he counsels, is about more than just sizing up candidates and waiting for a ring.

New legal partners, exasperated with Sharon's free-wheeling ways, want to kick her upstairs with a raise, perks, and a \"career opportunity\" that will chain her to a desk forever.Offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal, Sharon is in turmoil. And to make matters worse, Hy has disappeared. His abandoned plane, wrecked rental car, and a road map point to RKI, a firm of international security consultants with a reputation for questionable, unorthodox tactics and clients engaged in controversial research. Sharon discovers that they hired Hy as a free-lance operative and that they, too, are looking for him.Determined to find out what has happened, Sharon pushes aside her career concerns at All Souls and plunges into a search that will force her to take unlikely sanctuary in her abandoned San Diego childhood home and find and unexpected ally in her wild, unpredictable brother John.

So when he learns that he was made for someone in North Carolina, Jeremy hops right off to deliver himself to his new owner. But North Carolina is a long way from England, as Jeremy quickly learns. Before he can be safely home, Jeremy must rely on help from many people. There's old Mr. Pruneholt, who shows Jeremy where to find America; the kindly sea captain and his chattering parrot, Jethro, who see Jeremy across the water, and the unforgettable Village Dear. Most important of all are the family of young bunnies who teach Jeremy how wonderful it is to be needed. Though he'd love to stay with them, Jeremy can't forget that he has someone waiting for him and must keep moving until he arrives at her doorstep.   Jeremy, the Tale of an Honest Bunny is a story of adventure and friendship, full of humor, inspiration, and joy. It is the story of any child who is away from home-and the miracles found on the way to being safe at last.   Jan Karon says, \"I wanted to do something for my daughter that would last a long time-perhaps even a lifetime. So I wrote a book about a bunny named Jeremy who went on a journey.

He demonstrates that beneath both language and myth there lies an unconscious \"grammar\" of experience, whose categories and canons are not those of logical thought. He shows that this prelogical \"logic\" is not merely an undeveloped state of rationality, but something basically different, and that this archaic mode of thought still has enormous power over even our most rigorous thought, in language, poetry and myth.The author analyzes brilliantly such seemingly diverse (yet related) phenomena as the metaphysics of the Bhagavat Gita, the Melanesian concept of Mana, the Naturphilosophie of Schelling, modern poetry, Ancient Egyptian religion, and symbolic logic. He covers a vast range of material that is all too often neglected in studies of human thought.These six essays are of great interest to the student of philosophy or the philosophy of science, the historian, or the anthropologist. They are also remarkably timely for students of literature, what with the enormous emphasis placed upon \"myth\" in modern literary speculation. This book is not superficial speculation by a dabbler, but a penetrating study by one of the most profound and sensitive philosophic minds of our time.", "publisher": "Dover Publications"}, {"id": "d2d33c03-3227-4866-a2a5-3a582bd9212d", "title": "Ripken: Cal on Cal", "authors": ["By Ripken, Cal, Jr., Iooss, Walter (PHT), and Vancil, Mark (EDT)"], "year": "1997", "description": "Calvin Edwin Ripken Jr. was voted American League Rookie of the Year in 1982, and in the following year was named the league's Most Valuable Player - an award he received again in 1991.Named to his league's All-Star team twelve times, he has been a consistent offensive force, amassing more career home runs than any other shortstop, and he has fielded his position with captivating skill.

An important assignment, but pretty routine for a journalist of Chapman's abilities.The campaign itself, however, has been anything but routine. The American people face an impossible choice between apparent evil and apparent incompetence: The Republican candidate, David Donald Meredith, a handsome, charismatic figure and a riveting speaker, is a fundamentalist demagogue, a nativist, and probably a racist - none but the most fervent ideologues doubts that his election would tear the country apart. The Democrat, Paul L. Greene, is everything Meredith is not - liberal, earnest, and utterly colorless - and is so far behind in the polls that he has all but conceded the race weeks before the election.As the handlers, the press corps, the camera crews, and the campaign operators assemble in Williamsburg for the final battle of the campaign, a different sort of battle is taking place on the debate panel. Reporters have been given devastating anonymous reports about Meredith's personal life. There's no time to check them out, but using them could throw the election to Greene. In utter secrecy, a decision is made. By the time the debate is over, American politics and journalism have been changed forever and the four panelists have vaulted to mega-stardom.

From its birth in battle during the last days of World War II to its current aeronautical peak, the jet fighter has always been the king of the sky. Rendall's Rolling Thunder is the celebration of a machine, and a culture, for which \"winning is about accepting that there is no such thing as second-best.\"  Rendall's scrupulous history is driven by a strong thesis: jets may depend upon technological advances, but the human edge supplied by their pilots has determined their success or failure in all times and places. In this respect, the West has triumphed over its enemies. Beginning with the dangerously fast but hopelessly outnumbered German Me 262, jets and the men who flew them quickly became potent physical and psychological weapons. From the ruins of a defeated Germany came the now-familiar look of swept-back wings and with them the secret of supersonic flight. Less than a decade later, the two World War II allies most responsible for Germany's defeat would meet as enemies in Korea. Their planes -- the American F-86 Saber and Russian MiG-15 -- clashed over the Yalu River in what American pilots called \"MiG Alley.\" Diving from 40,000 feet and flying through dry riverbeds so low that their engines kicked up dirt, both sides' machines soon proved their worth.  In Vietnam, American fighter pilots involved in the costly \"Rolling Thunder\" campaign again proved the value of the American emphasis on individualism as taught in the \"Top Gun\" school of aeronautics. Rendall vividly describes pilots in F-4 Phantoms and F-105 Thunderchiefs dodging SA-2 surface-to-air missiles in the \"ultimate test of man versus machine.\"  Recent uses of air power, from the legendary \"Instant Thunder\" campaign in the Gulf War to the enforcement of No-Fly Zones in Bosnia, have proved that the jet fighter remains as versatile and dangerous as ever. But today, with $100 million mach 3 machines capable of climbing 65,000 feet -- twice the height of Everest -- in a minute, many have argued that the pilot has become the weak link in the jet fighter's lethal equation. Rendall shows that the argument to remove the pilot from his machine -- seemingly complete with NASA's new unmanned X-36 -- is as old as the machine that broke the sound barrier, Chuck Yeager's X-1. The ability to balance the grace and brutality of a machine that has evolved into a perfect combination of form and function will remain the unique province of the fighter pilot -- the \"quintessential warrior of our times.\"", "publisher": "Free Press"}, {"id": "6f55164e-a3c7-4bcf-a4ef-2a312204165a", "title": "The Everything Cover Letter Book (Everything)", "authors": ["By Graber, Steven and Lipsman, Mark"], "year": "2000", "description": "Parsing the allimportant cover letter, this career guide to crafting effective correspondance during a job search includes advice on writing cold letters, cover letters, thank letters, followup letters, and much more.

His gutsy, take-no-prisoners interviews and commentary on the Fox News Channel's Hannity & Colmes have made him one of cable television's most popular personalities. And his ascendance to the top of the talk radio world with ABC Radio's The Sean Hannity Show has won him a huge and devoted following that includes not only conservatives but anyone else who values straight talk over pandering and excuses.Now, in Let Freedom Ring, Sean Hannity offers a survey of the worldâpolitical, social, and culturalâas he sees it. Devoting special attention to 9/11, the war on terror, and the continuing threat we face at home and abroad, he makes clear that the greatest challenge we have to overcome may not be an attack from overseas, but the slow compromising of our national character. And he asks why, particularly in this time of war, should we entrust our future to the voices of the Leftâthe very people who have spent decades ravaging so many of our core values and traditions?Our nation, as Hannity reminds us, was founded on the idea of freedom. And in order to protect our freedoms, he argues, we must stand vigilant against liberal attempts to compromise our strengths. From our military and intelligence forces, to our borders and airports, to our unified commitment to root out terrorists at home and abroad, he reveals how our strongest lines of defense have come under attackâby left-wing voices within our government, media, schools, and elsewhere. And he shows how even domestic issues like taxation, education, patriotism, and the family have been exploited by liberals with their own agendasâwith potentially disastrous results.Filled with the commonsense commentary and passionate argument that have made Sean Hannity the most compelling conservative voice since Rush Limbaugh, Let Freedom Ring is an urgent call to arms.

Only by going public with his theory--that dreams manifest hidden wishes--did Freud establish a position to defend and embark upon a career. That position and career have been among the most influential in this century. In August 1899, Freud wrote to Wilhelm Fliess of the dream book in terms reminiscent of Dante's Inferno. Beginning from a dark wood, this modern journey features \"a concealed pass though which I lead the reader--my specimen dream with its peculiarities, details, indiscretions, bad jokes--and then suddenly the high ground and the view and the question, Which way do you wish to go now?\" Physician that he is, Freud appoints himself guide rather than hero, yet the way \"you\" wish to go is very much his prescribed way. In Welsh's book, readers are invited on Freud's journey, to pause at each concealed pass in his seminal work and ask where the guide is taking them and why. Along the way, Welsh shows how Freud's arbitrary turnings are themselves wishful, intended to persuade by pleasing the reader and author alike; that his interest in secrets and his self-proclaimed modest ambition are products of their time; and that the book may best be read as a romance or serial comedy. \"Some of the humor throughout,\" Welsh notes, \"can only be understood as a particular kind of fine performance.\" Welsh offers the first critical overview of the argument in Freud's masterpiece and of the author who presents himself as guide.", "publisher": "Princeton University Press"}, {"id": "fc7eb5b7-94b5-4766-ba91-0dfebdec24e8", "title": "Ingenious Inventions of Domestic Utility", "authors": ["By Bragdon, Allen D."], "year": "1989", "description": "Shows examples of antique American household utensils, describes their function, and looks at nineteenth century home life", "publisher": "HarperCollins"}, {"id": "1d6e5524-3ce4-42bd-9f3e-0de7ab97ca19", "title": "Complete Idiot's Guide to Parenting Your Teenager (The Complete Idiot's Guide)", "authors": ["By Kelly, Kate"], "year": "1996", "description": "The Complete Idiot's Guide to Parenting a Teenager teaches you how to navigate adolescence successfully with your teen.

The twin towers of the World Trade Center came crashing down, one side of the Pentagon burst into flame, and more than six thousand men, women, and children lost their lives in the most deadly terrorist attack on American soil. As shocking as it was, it had been long in the making: The assault was the most sophisticated and horrifying in a series of operations masterminded by Osama bin Laden and his Jihad group -- an organization that CNN's terrorism analyst Peter Bergen calls Holy War, Inc.  One of only a handful of Western journalists to have interviewed the world's most wanted man face to face, Peter Bergen has produced the definitive book on the Jihadist network that operates globally and in secrecy. In the course of four years of investigative reporting, he has interviewed scores of insiders -- from bin Laden associates and family members to Taliban leaders to CIA officials -- and traveled to Afghanistan, Yemen, Egypt, Pakistan, and the United Kingdom to learn the truth about bin Laden's al Queda organization and his mission.  Immense in scope and unnerving in its findings, Holy War, Inc. reveals:   How bin Laden lives, travels, and communicates with his \"cells.\" How his role in the crushing defeat of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan made him a hero to Muslims all over the world -- and equipped him to endure a long and bloody siege. How the CIA ended up funding -- to the tune of three billion dollars -- radical, anti-American Afghan groups allied to bin Laden. How the attacks that foreshadowed the destruction of the World Trade Center -- among them the bombings of the American embassies in Africa and the warship USS Cole in Yemen -- were planned and executed. The dimensions of bin Laden's personal fortune, and why freezing his assets is both futile and nearly impossible. The ideology of bin Laden's number two, the man who has influenced him most profoundly in his holy war -- the Egyptian Ayman al Zawahiri. What we can expect from Islamist extremists in the future.   Above all, Peter Bergen helps us to see bin Laden's organization in a radically new light: as a veritable corporation that has exploited twenty-first-century communications and weapons technologies in the service of a medieval reading of the Koran and holy war. Holy War, Inc. is essential reading for anyone trying to understand tomorrow's terrorist threats and the militant Islamist movements that could determine the fate of governments -- and human lives -- the world over.  Both author and publisher will donate a portion of the proceeds from this book to United Way's September 11th Fund for the relief of victims of the World Trade Center attacks.", "publisher": "Free Press"}, {"id": "959bd313-737b-471c-aa4f-55c92486205f", "title": "Flavor", "authors": ["By DiSpirito, Rocco, Leutwyler, Henry, and Sherer, Kris"], "year": "2003", "description": "\"Knockout dining\" leaves fans breathless at this Gramercy New American \"paragon\" where \"rock star\" chef Rocco DiSpirito produces \"sublime,\" \"synergistic\" dishes. --Zagat, on Rocco DiSpirito's restaurant Union Pacific He runs one of the most successful restaurants in New York City.

That book ended in 1972, with McCainâs release from imprisonment in Vietnam. This is the rest of his story, about his great American journey from the U.S. Navy to his electrifying run for the presidency, interwoven with heartfelt portraits of the mavericks who have inspired him through the yearsâTed Williams, Theodore Roosevelt, visionary aviation proponent Billy Mitchell, Marlon Brando in Viva Zapata!, and, most indelibly, Robert Jordan. It was Jordan, Hemingwayâs protagonist in For Whom the Bell Tolls, who showed McCain the ideals of heroism and sacrifice, stoicism and redemption, and why certain causes, despite the costs, are . . .Worth the Fighting ForAfter five and a half years as a prisoner of war in Vietnam, naval aviator John McCain returned home a changed man. Regaining his health and flight-eligibility status, he resumed his military career, commanding carrier pilots and serving as the navyâs liaison to what is sometimes ironically called the worldâs most exclusive club, the United States Senate. Accompanying Senators John Tower and Henry âScoopâ Jackson on international trips, McCain began his political education in the company of two masters, leaders whose standards he would strive to maintain upon his election to the U.S. Congress. There, he learned valuable lessons in cooperation from a good-humored congressman from the other party, Morris Udall. In 1986, McCain was elected to the U.S. Senate, inheriting the seat of another role model, Barry Goldwater.During his time in public office, McCain has seen acts of principle and acts of craven self-interest. He describes both ex-tremes in these pages, with his characteristic straight talk and humor. He writes honestly of the lowest point in his career, the Keating Five savings and loan debacle, as well as his triumphant momentsâhis return to Vietnam and his efforts to normalize relations between the U.S. and Vietnamese governments; his fight for campaign finance reform; and his galvanizing bid for the presidency in 2000.Writes McCain: âA rebel without a cause is just a punk. Whatever youâre calledârebel, unorthodox, nonconformist, radicalâitâs all self-indulgence without a good cause to give your life meaning.â This is the story of McCainâs causes, the people who made him do it, and the meaning he found.

She was immediately struck by their deep, saturated colors, the geometric simplicity of their design, and their quiet power. \"They spoke directly to me,\" she writes. \"They knew something.They went straight to my heart.\" That was the beginning of her \"journey of the spirit.\"Plain and Simple, illustrated with the author's own drawings, is the gentle, eloquent story of that journey. Bender, a wife, a mother, and a dedicated artist from Berkeley, California, sought out Amish families that would allow her-one of the outsiders the Amish call the \"English\"-- to visit and share in their daily fives.In language as spare and vivid as Amish art, Bender recounts her venture into an entirely different world, the seemingly timeless world of the Amish, a landscape of immense inner quiet. With an inquiring eye, she describes the months she spent in Iowa and Ohio with two Amish families. She illuminates the everyday rhythms of their world and conveys the life of the people who taught her about simplicity, commitment, and the joy of doing what you do well.In nine chapters, as interrelated and well-crafted as a classic nine-patch Amish quilt, Bender speaks to the seeker in us all and reveals how she was drawn to -- and changed by -- the Amish values of austerity, humility, and the ordinary. \"How\" they live reflects what they believe\" she writes. \"Their life is their art!\"After living and working with these people whose values were so unlike her own, Bender was able to return home and rework her \"crazy quilt\" life into a new pattern. \"I thought I was going to learn more about their quilts,\" she writes, \"but the quilts were only guides, leading me to what I really needed to learn, to answer a question I hadn't yet formed: \"Is there another way to lead a good life?\"", "publisher": "HarperOne"}, {"id": "dd245f22-f041-4796-aea4-943c101eb99c", "title": "7 Simple Steps to Unclutter Your Life", "authors": ["By Smallin, Donna"], "year": "2000", "description": "For readers who yearn for more balance in their lives, hundreds of quick tips and ideas for enhancing physical, emotional, and spiritual well-being, and creating a simpler, more rewarding lifestyle.

But how far removed from reality are such fictitious creations? Will there ever be an intelligent robot in our future? Neural networks expert Maureen Caudill says yes. In fact, she argues that the development of intelligent androids is a mere twenty years away.    In Our Own Image reveals just how far we've come in developing an intelligent robot, describes what technical obstacles must still be cleared, and--perhaps most interesting of all--outlines the potentially massive social disruptions and tangled moral and legal dilemmas these \"human machines\" will cause. In a sweeping look at state-of-the-art breakthroughs in artificial intelligence, robotics, computer science, psychology, and neural networks, Caudill shows how these fields have advanced machine vision, language recognition, problem solving, memory, and other requisites of intelligent robots. She describes foot-long mechanical ants that can follow you around a room, robots that can crack eggs, shear sheep, play ping-pong, tighten wing-nuts, and other feats of dexterity. (One robot, WABOT-2, developed in Japan, can read simple sheet music and played the electric organ with the NHK Symphony Orchestra of Japan.) electric organ.) And she concludes that as our ability to make faster, smaller, cheaper computers blends with our ability to mimic the behavior of the human mind, the first truly intelligent machines come closer to fruition. But once an android has been perfected, Caudill warns, there will likely be some unexpected--and perhaps unpleasant--social changes. Androids may compete with human workers for jobs--and robots won't take vacations, won't have family problems, and might never leave the firm. Androids may also entangle our legal system in complex, difficult questions: Can an individual own an intelligent android? What rights should it have in society? Does ownership of an android imply the right to turn it off--the right to \"kill\" it? And does such ownership brand us as slaveholders?    The existence of intelligent androids will provoke these and other questions. Caudill concludes that we will soon be forced to come up with answers if we are to learn to share the world with another intelligent species--one of our own creation.", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}, {"id": "78a03456-17f3-4020-926b-52f55089b184", "title": "Death and Deconstruction", "authors": ["By Fleming, Anne"], "year": "1995", "description": "John Charter is cajoled by his former wife Sophie into abandoning an Irish fishing trip to instead spend his vacation investigating a series of hoaxes on the Coleridge and Other Romantic Poets Society.

Appointed by President Bush to be chairman of the National Endowment for the Arts, he was abruptly fired two and a half years later in a storm of front-page controversy.Leaving Town Alive is Frohnmayer's lively and startlingly candid account of his trial by fire in the brutal world of power politics. Taking over the NEA amid the uproar about Robert Mapplethorpe's sexually explicit photographs, Frohnmayer stood at the center of the emotional debate over public funding for the arts. On the left were staunch defenders of free speech and the artists whose confrontational works came under attack. On the right were Jesse Helms and the fundamentalist proponents of traditional values.At first Frohnmayer assumed that he could negotiate anything and that everyone had the best interests of the country at heart. He was wrong: the White House, for instance, just wanted the problem of \"offensive art\" to go away, while right-wing fund-raisers wanted to keep the issue alive as long as possible. In the end, Frohnmayer's harrowing education changed him. He entered the fray a First Amendment moderate; he emerged a free-speech radical.John Frohnmayer had an insider's view of Washington during the Bush years, and he writes with remarkable frankness about the bitter battles over the government's involvement in the arts. Passionate, witty, and wonderfully readable, Leaving Town Alive is, finally, an eloquent plea for the liberation of American culture from the narrow concerns of partisan politics.", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, {"id": "6ce1bf0c-5ef6-4478-a4b1-938c8641c9e7", "title": "A Show of Hands: Say It in Sign Language", "authors": ["By Sullivan, Mary Beth and Bourke, Linda"], "year": "1985", "description": "An introduction to the language used by many deaf and hearing-impaired people teaches youngsters how to spell messages in the air and how to order french fries without saying a word", "publisher": "Trophy Pr"}, {"id": "08eeacc6-a187-4efd-918f-8e82c5b49077", "title": "Silent Sons: A Book for and About Men", "authors": ["By Ackerman, Robert J."], "year": "1994", "description": "It could be you or someone you love. Strong, silent types are everywhere, and it is their telltale silence that has kept their problems hidden until now. A silent son can come from a family that coped with violence, alcoholism, child abuse, extreme rigidity, or divorce, but all silent sons have certain common characteristics:   They keep things that bother them to themselves.  They deny that unpleasant events occur.  They fear letting people know them.  They have difficulty interacting with their parents, spouses, or children.  They have a strong fear of criticism.  They are often angry.   In Silent Sons, Dr. Robert Ackerman, a silent son himself, examines the problems that commonly confront silent sons, keeping them from experiencing the full range of human emotions. In a compassionate and hopeful voice, the author defines the silent son and examines the impact of parents, particularly fathers, on these men and shows how their dysfunctional upbringing affects their present relationships, especially with women.  By putting aside anger, finding peace with one's self, and looking for support from other silent sons, Dr. Ackerman feels every man can realize his full potential and become a well balanced, healthy survivor.", "publisher": "Touchstone"}, {"id": "393013a7-d829-4891-9cfd-f2b1430de795", "title": "Walker Evans: A Biography", "authors": ["By Evans, Walker and Rathbone, Belinda"], "year": "2000", "description": "Walker Evan's photographs are American classics.

Christian Europe, a remote land beyond its northwestern frontier, was seen as an outer darkness of barbarism and unbelief from which there was nothing to learn or to fear. And then everything changed, as the previously despised West won victory after victory, first in the battlefield and the marketplace, then in almost every aspect of public and even private life.    In this intriguing volume, Bernard Lewis examines the anguished reaction of the Islamic world as it tried to understand why things had changed--how they had been overtaken, overshadowed, and to an increasing extent dominated by the West. Lewis provides a fascinating portrait of a culture in turmoil. He shows how the Middle East turned its attention to understanding European weaponry and military tactics, commerce and industry, government and diplomacy, education and culture. Lewis highlights the striking differences between the Western and Middle Eastern cultures from the 18th to the 20th centuries through thought-provoking comparisons of such things as Christianity and Islam, music and the arts, the position of women, secularism and the civil society, the clock and the calendar.   Hailed in The New York Times Book Review as \"the doyen of Middle Eastern studies,\" Bernard Lewis is one of the West's foremost authorities on Islamic history and culture.

In so doing, she illuminates with great sensitivity and intelligence the elusive emotional wellsprings of the creative process.There is no ideal muse, but rather as many variations on the theme as there are individual women who have had the luck, or misfortune, to find their destiny conjoined with that of a particular artist. What are we to make of the relationship between the child Alice Liddell, who inspired Alice in Wonderland, and the Oxford don who became Lewis Carroll? Or the so-called serial muse, Lou Andreas-SalomÃ©, who captivated Nietzsche, Rilke, and Freudâas impressive a list as any muse can boast? Salvador DalÃ­ was the only artist to sign his art with his muse's name, and Gala DalÃ­ certainly knew how to market her artist and his work while simultaneously burnishing her own image and celebrity.Lou, Gala, and Yoko Ono all defy the feminist stereotype of the muse as a passive beauty put on a pedestal and oppressed by a male artist. However, it's rare to find an artist and muse who are genuine partners, true collaborators, such as ballerina Suzanne Farrell and choreographer George Balanchine.What do the nine muses chosen by Francine Prose have in common? They were all beautiful, or sexy, or gifted with some more unconventional appeal. All loved, and were loved by, their artists, and inspired them with an intensity of emotion akin to Eros.

Responding to the controversy, Robert Dallek's groundbreaking book argues that the pressures generated by unresolved political and social domestic problems have shaped American foreign policy. In an illuminating examination of each significant period--from the expansionism of the Spanish-American War and the American entrance into World War I, to American-Soviet relations during World War II, the Cold War period that followed, and American involvement in Korea and Vietnam--Dallek reveals why we have acted as we have, often in the face of logic and with costly consequences.       Providing a wealth of new insights, he presents American foreign policies in the twentieth century as symbolic extensions of domestic hopes and fears.

Rose of Pennsylvania and dozens more tunneled out of notorious Libby Prison; the genteel Union sympathizer Elizabeth Van Lew conducted an elaborate and extraordinarily successful campaign of espionage.

At twelve, Aron Kleinfeld is the ringleader among the boys in his Jerusalem neighborhood, their inspiration in dreaming up games and adventures. But as his friends begin to mature, Aron remains imprisoned for three long years in the body of a child. While Israel inches toward the Six-Day War, and while the voices of his friends change and become strange to him, Aron lives in his child body as though in a nightmare. Like a spy in enemy territory, he learns to decipher the internal codes of sexuality and desire, to understand the unyielding bureaucracy of the human body. Hurled between childhood and adulthood, between the pure and the profane, he is like a volcano of emotions and impulses. But, like his hero Houdini, Aron still struggles to escape from the trap of growing up.The Book of Intimate Grammar is about the alchemy of childhood, which transforms loneliness and fear into creation, and about the struggle to emerge as an artist.

Drawing on the latest findings from developmental, psychobiological, and social scientific research, DeGrandpre seeks to solve the problem of ADD by \"solving\" its history.

The key characters are the top corporate executives, public health investigators, and antismoking activists who have clashed ever more stridently as Americans debate whether smoking should be closely regulated as a major health menace.We see tobacco spread rapidly from its aboriginal sources in the New World 500 years ago, as it becomes increasingly viewed by some as sinful and some as alluring, and by government as a windfall source of tax revenue. With the arrival of the cigarette in the late-nineteenth century, smoking changes from a luxury and occasional pastime to an everyday -- to some, indispensable -- habit, aided markedly by the exuberance of the tobacco huskers.This free-enterprise success saga grows shadowed, from the middle of this century, as science begins to understand the cigarette's toxicity. Ironically the more detailed and persuasive the findings by medical investigators, the more cigarette makers prosper by seeming to modify their product with filters and reduced dosages of tar and nicotine.We see the tobacco manufacturers come under intensifying assault as a rogue industry for knowingly and callously plying their hazardous wares while insisting that the health charges against them (a) remain unproven, and (b) are universally understood, so smokers indulge at their own risk.Among the eye-opening disclosures here: outrageous pseudo-scientific claims made for cigarettes throughout the '30s and '40s, and the story of how the tobacco industry and the National Cancer Institute spent millions to develop a \"safer\" cigarette that was never brought to market.Dealing with an emotional subject that has generated more heat than light, this book is a dispassionate tour de force that examines the nature of the companies' culpability, the complicity of society as a whole, and the shaky moral ground claimed by smokers who are now demanding recompense.", "publisher": "Knopf"}, {"id": "dac51bf4-a43a-44dd-944e-775fc766ed20", "title": "Recyclopedia: Games, Science Equipment, and Crafts from Recycled Materials", "authors": ["By Simons, Robin"], "year": "1976", "description": "Suggestions for games, crafts, and scientific equipment that can be made from recycled materials.", "publisher": "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt"}, {"id": "ecc1083e-87ea-4e42-868e-1290cf213d8d", "title": "The Survival Factor", "authors": ["By Birkhead, Mike and Birkhead, Tim"], "year": "1991", "description": "Describes the unusual adaptations animals use to survive in harsh environments, and looks at the cuckoo, spadefoot toad, mountain goat, woodpecker, and California ground squirrel", "publisher": "Facts on File"}, {"id": "95a4fd33-2fe7-4e99-ad0e-29f5bf472135", "title": "World of Our Fathers: The Journey of The Eastern European Jews to America", "authors": ["By Libo, Kenneth and Howe, Irving"], "year": "1989", "description": "Recounts the experiences of the East European Jews who settled in New York's East Side", "publisher": "Harcourt"}, {"id": "8f2ec99e-4fdf-4163-814e-f6491a617033", "title": "Dance Of A Fallen Monk: The Twists And Turns Of A Spiritual Life", "authors": ["By Fowler, George"], "year": "1995", "description": "From a hardscrabble Montana youth, to twenty-one years of celibacy as a Trappist monk and priest, to his excommunication from the Catholic Church for marrying a nun, Fowler's story is one of a thinker and activist motivated by a quest for true spiritual understanding.", "publisher": "Da Capo Press"}, {"id": "14f58630-aa6f-49d8-af61-1d3c42b5c438", "title": "Intervention and Reflection: Basic Issues in Medical Ethics (Philosophy)", "authors": ["By Munson, Ronald and Hoffman, Christopher A."], "year": "1995", "description": "This unique combination of text, reader, and casebook provides coverage of the fundamental topics in current medical ethics and familiarizes the reader with the basic moral and social issues confronting the medical profession today.", "publisher": "Wadsworth Publishing"}, {"id": "e376060c-d1dd-4f3c-b896-e99668294c8f", "title": "Ronald Reagan: His Life In Pictures", "authors": ["By Spada, James"], "year": "2001", "description": "An extraordinary life story in more than 340 photographs, most never before published.Ronald Wilson Reagan lived the American Dream-- over and over again.

The last president to serve as a living link between the nineteenth and the twentieth centuries, Trumanâs story spans the raw world of the Missouri frontier, World War I, the powerful Pendergast machine of Kansas City, the legendary Whistle-Stop Campaign of 1948, and the decisions to drop the atomic bomb, confront Stalin at Potsdam, send troops to Korea, and fire General MacArthur.

Nearly three decades have passed since the original edition of America?based on journalist-historian Cookeâs extraordinarily popular thirteen-part television series?sold more than a million copies. Yet Cookeâs view of Americaâs dynamic past and its impact upon the always-changing present continues to provide striking insights into the singular character of a nation. Those thirty years since award-winning America first rose to the top of best-seller lists have themselves wrought further dramatic changes. Presidents have been impeached, economies have toppled, empires have collapsed, and towers have fallen. In light of such events, Cooke has written for this new edition a compelling introduction and final chapter that bring his story of America up to date with the wisdom of the inimitably grand old man of correspondents. And what a story this book tells. From the discovery of America by European explorers to modern times; from the fighters for independence to the pioneers who tamed the West; from the slaves who fled to freedom to the huddled masses that sought a new life in the New World.

American power was expanding and American writersâincluding Emerson, Thoreau, Hawthorne, and Whitmanâwere acclaimed at home and abroad. Englandâs condescending air toward America had already become inappropriate. The United States had reached a new level of respectability in the world. In light of this favorable international climate, why then did some of Americaâs most talented young writers travel to London to become, as Henry Adams put it, âimprovised Europeansâ?Few writers have been studied and analyzed as much as the quartet at the heart of this book. But Alex Zwerdling was perplexed by this shared and often overlooked aspect of their background: Why, at the dawn of the American century, did these writers choose to go âbackâ to what was called âthe Old Worldâ? And why would these brilliant thinkers include in some of their most acclaimed work material that is today reviled as offensiveâanti-Semetic, racist, anti-feminist? What was happening in the United States that repelled them? In striving to answer these questions, Alex Zwerdling illuminates the lives and careers of Henry Adams, Henry James, T.S. Eliot, and Ezra Pound as never before.These men chose to live their lives abroad at a crucial point in American history, both domestically and internationally. The massive influx of immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe began to whittle away the Anglo-Saxon majority. The end of slavery created a renewal of efforts to make true the Constitutionâs claim to universal equality. Womenâs confidence and authority grew as they fought for independence and their own rights. These developments, Zwerdling argues, were large factors in why these four writers fled. He examines their works and their lives in the context of the American scene they left, and also in the context of the British scene they left for. His brilliant cultural history uses personal correspondence, unprinted articles, and other previously unknown sources to unravel the historical forces that shaped these literary lions. Depicting their careers as a roller-coaster ride through alien territory, the book shows that they produced extraordinary work in the midst of perpetual friction, indifferece, and even active hostility.", "publisher": "Basic Books"}, {"id": "0a18ce19-8c92-4bf3-9ad9-f4daff6a6870", "title": "Forever Beautiful With Rex: Makeup Strategies for the Rest of Your Life", "authors": ["By Jewell, Diana Lewis, Rex (ILT), and Rex"], "year": "1994", "description": "The best-selling creators of Making Up demonstrate the principles of beauty for women of all ages, presenting full-color illustrations and photographs of real-life models that stress that every age has its own unique beauty. 25,000 first printing.", "publisher": "Clarkson Potter"}, {"id": "63a386fd-48be-4ba2-898c-671e4d1e10bd", "title": "Best Places to Stay in the Caribbean, Sixth Edition", "authors": ["By Jamison, Cheryl Alters, Jamison, Bill, and Shaw, Bruce"], "year": "2000", "description": "The most comprehensive guide to outstanding, distinctive lodging options in the CaribbeanNo fee accepted for inclusionAlmost every kind of vacation experience is available in the Caribbean, but the first step toward reaching your vacation aspirations is choosing the right place to stay.

Nancy Mairs's essays have been called \"triumphs... of will, style, candor, thought and even form\" (Los Angeles Times). She has won acclaim for her autobiographical writing on themes from living with depression to renewing a marriage, from sex to religion. In Voice Lessons, Mairs's subjects are literary, but as always her approach is personal, revealing, and inspiring. Mairs first shares her sharply drawn story on how \"finding a voice\" as an essayist transformed her life when she was a graduate student, wife, and mother in her late thirties. In a tribute to the liberating power of literature and feminist ideas, she shows how the words of other writers made possible a new career, a new life in difficult times. Voice Lessons goes on to explore other women's writing and to outline a singular kind of literary life. Always grounding her writing in personal experience, always making ideas concrete, Mairs gives us essays on writing and the body, the challenges of autobiography, the revelatory power of Virginia Woolf and Alice Walker, the literature of personal disaster, and the art of dealing with rejection. Articulate, witty, incisive, and inspirational, Voice Lessons is a book for writers and aspiring writers, and for everyone who loves women's writing.", "publisher": "Beacon Press"}, {"id": "caef580d-e4f6-403a-b0bf-2ce08eed05d7", "title": "The New Face of Terrorism: Threats from Weapons of Mass Destruction", "authors": ["By Cole, Benjamin and Gurr, Nadine"], "year": "2000", "description": "Examines and assesses the new style of terrorism by small groups, cults and individuals with access to chemical, nuclear or biological weapons.

Some were pushed rather than drawn back by rootlessness, joblessness, and urban decay. Others, made stronger by the uncompromising demands of city life, came home determined to apply the hard lessons they'd learned up north to build new lives in the South. Still others returned to recover what they had lost. Children often were sent home first, either to be cared for or to help care for grandparents who never left.Call to Home is the story of hardships - of starting over, of poverty, of rural life - but is also the story of success, of how people determined to build real communities and to set things right helped to establish the right of black Americans to participate as full citizens in the American South.", "publisher": "Basic Books"}, {"id": "2269893f-7b1b-4b0d-b285-d00908119d6d", "title": "The Ordinary Seaman", "authors": ["By Goldman, Francisco and Golman, Francisco"], "year": "1998", "description": "The Ordinary Seaman, the second novel from acclaimed writer Francisco Goldman is a lyrical and spellbinding story of hope, despair, and the promise of love.

Its title: \"Must America Save the World?\" Their answer was a resounding yes. Indeed, Joseph and Stewart Alsop were there in those heady postwar years when the country's foreign-policy elite created what became known as the American Century. As men of words, they served as confidants of and cheerleaders for the men of deeds, who came largely from the country's patrician class.The Alsop brothers were themselves sons of this class. Theodore Roosevelt was the brothers' great-uncle. Eleanor Roosevelt was their mother's first cousin. They grew up with members of this Anglo-Saxon elite, went to school with them, socialized with them. And they threw the considerable weight of their column behind the efforts of these statesmen to refashion the world. Writing four times a week, they appeared in nearly two hundred newspapers; their work also graced the pages of the major magazines of the time. Thus, they wielded immense influence throughout the nation from the victory in World War II to the defeat in Vietnam.Stewart was a political analyst of rare acumen, while Joe, his older brother, was a curmudgeon with an aristocratic bearing and a biting wit. He once likened a dinner at Lyndon Johnson's to \"going to an opera in which one man sings all the parts.\" He was a friend and confidant of John Kennedy, a teacher of Washington ways to Jackie Kennedy. When he called people in the highest echelons of officialdom, they responded.In Taking On the World, Robert W. Merry, a Washington insider himself, has fashioned an intricate and fascinating combination of biography and narrative history. As Mr. Merry puts it, \"Within the lifetime of the Alsop brothers the country was remade. And its remaking illuminates their careers, just as their careers illuminate the American Century.\" Robert Merry casts brilliant light on these two remarkable men, and on one of the most tumultuous periods of the country's history.", "publisher": "Viking Adult"}, {"id": "dd6c30d2-52c3-4beb-9efe-00485b1eeef2", "title": "Born to Rebel: Birth Order, Family Dynamics, and Creative Lives", "authors": ["By Sulloway, Frank J."], "year": "1996", "description": "Why are individuals from the same family often no more similar in personality than those from different families? Why, within the same family, do some children conform to authority whereas others rebel? The family, it turns out, is not a \"shared environment\" but rather a set of niches that provide siblings with different outlooks.At the heart of this pioneering inquiry into human development is a fundamental insight: that the personalities of siblings vary because they adopt different strategies in the universal quest for parental favor. Frank J. Sulloway's most important finding is that eldest children identify with parents and authority, and support the status quo, whereas younger children rebel against it. Drawing on the work of Darwin and the new sciences of evolutionary psychology, he transforms our understanding of personality development and its origins in family dynamics.Most persuasively, Sulloway's findings offer conclusive evidence that the family, with its powerful interpersonal dynamics, is a cauldron for the great revolutionary advances that drive historical change. Through his analysis of revolutions in social and scientific thought, from the Reformation to Darwin's theory of natural selection, Sulloway demonstrates that the primary engine of history is located within families, not between them, as Marx believed.This landmark work illuminates the crucial influence that family niches have on personality, and documents the profound consequences of sibling competition - not only on individual development within the family, but on society as a whole.

(COR), Geer, George S. (EDT), and Marvel, William (EDT)"], "year": "2000", "description": "Marking the ongoing efforts to recover the 136-year-old wreck of the USS Monitor, The Mariners' Museum presents a lavishly illustrated commemorative volume of the renowned Civil War ironclad's past and present.  The short, fabled life of the USS Monitor began on January 30, 1862, at Green Point, Brooklyn, New York, and ended on December 31 of that same year, when the legendary Civil War ironclad sank in 230 feet of water off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Serving on the Monitor -- where engines and living space lay completely below the waterline and the iron deck rose a scant eighteen inches above it -- was like no other duty in the U.S. Navy. The Monitor Chronicles brings shipboard experience to life through the words of Civil War sailor George S. Geer, whose never-before-published letters home to his beloved wife, Martha, faithfully chronicle the events of that dramatic year. Like many men of his station, George Geer had joined Abraham Lincoln's navy less to help save the Union than to earn money and learn a reliable trade, so his accounts are unflinchingly honest -- at times colored by the bravado of a man at war, at others tinged with the pathos of a man in danger and far from home. When, on the morning of March 9, 1862, the Monitor and the CSS Virginia fought the first battle between ironclad warships, Geer recalled,\"I often thought of you and the little darlings when the fight was going on and what should become of you should I be killed....But I should have no more such fears as our ship resisted everything they could fire at her as though they were spit balls.\" Whether he sweated in the searing heat or simply waited while the Monitor danced a strategic minuet with the enemy, his words confirm and amplify the proud legacy of the vessel whose very existence brought an end to the era of wooden warships. On January 2, 1863, Geer reported, \"I am sorry to have to write you that we have lost the Monitor.\" He survived, but sixteen men were lost in a raging sea that seemed to have claimed the ship for eternity. But the story told in The Monitor Chronicles doesn't end there. The book captures a piece of living history, as men and machines attempt to recover the wreck even as it begins to succumb to the elements after 136 years on the ocean floor. Because The Mariners' Museum serves as the official repository of the USS Monitor National Marine Sanctuary, readers will be treated to spectacular underwater views of the Monitor, as well as to an unprecedented look at the salvage efforts. Although more than a century has passed since the ship itself sailed into history, The Monitor Chronicles provides not only a fresh, uniquely intimate view of the Monitor's fateful year as the world's first iron warship but also a provocative glimpse of", "publisher": "Simon & Schuster"}, {"id": "0bfdb836-bbc3-4541-b894-97ce992f5491", "title": "Fire in My Soul", "authors": ["By Lester, Joan Steinau and Norton, Eleanor Holmes"], "year": "2003", "description": "Here is the remarkable story of U.S. Congresswoman Eleanor Holmes Norton -- impassioned civil rights activist, hard-driving legislator, and one of the most powerful women in American history.  They call her the \"Warrior on the Hill,\" acknowledging the battles she's waged as a political pioneer across more than four decades of American history. Perhaps more than anyone else, she has taken to heart Eleanor Roosevelt's famous pronouncement that \"every political woman needs to develop skin as tough as rhinoceros hide.\"  Joan Steinau Lester shared much of the last forty years with Eleanor Holmes Norton. They met in 1958 when they were both students at Antioch College. Now an acclaimed author, Lester shares her friendship with the congresswoman and tells the story of one woman's rise to leadership. Charting forty years of political and personal challenge, Fire in My Soul shows Norton marching on the Capitol to demand a Senate hearing for Anita Hill; grilling Army generals about sex abuse; arguing before the Supreme Court to uphold first amendment rights, even for a segregationist; and much more. Norton's story is organically linked to Washington, D.C., home to her family for four generations, and reveals why she is now the voice of the city.  This fascinating biography, told largely in Norton's words, showcases as never before the many facets of a woman who remains an iconic torch-bearer for the legacy of the Civil Rights Movement. Scores of conversations with Norton and nearly a hundred interviews with colleagues, family, and friends have made Fire in My Soul a remarkable document of how one extraordinary woman helped to effect lasting change in the ways we interact across racial and gender lines.", "publisher": "Atria"}, {"id": "a155f70a-ac49-498f-a3d9-b4ac1da8e1da", "title": "Maryland Wits and Baltimore Bards: A Literary History with Notes on Washington Writers (Maryland Paperback Bookshelf)", "authors": ["By Shivers, Frank R."], "year": "1998", "description": "In this first comprehensive literary history of Baltimore and Maryland (with notes on Washington writers), Frank R.

Why does the entertainment industry attack religion, glorify brutality, undermine the family, and deride patriotism? In this explosive book, one of the nation's best known film critics examines how Hollywood has broken faith with its public, creating movies, television, and popular music that exacerbate every serious social problem we face, from teenage pregnancies to violence in the streets. Michael Medved powerfully argues that the entertainment business follows its own dark obsessions, rather than giving the public what it wants: In fact, the audience for feature films and network television has demonstrated its profound disillusionment in recent years, with disastrous consequences for many entertainment companies.  Meanwhile, overwhelming numbers of our fellow citizens complain about the wretched quality of our popular culture--describing the offerings of the mass media as the worst ever.  Medved asserts that Hollywood ignores--and assaults--the values of ordinary American families, pursuing a self-destructive and alienated ideological agenda that is harmful to the nation at large and to the industry's own interests. In hard-hitting chapters on \"The Attack on Religion,\" \"The Addiction to Violence,\" \"Promoting Promiscuity,\" \"The Infatuation with Foul Language,\" \"Kids Know Best,\" \"Motivations for Madness,\" and other subjects, Medved outlines the underlying themes that turn up again and again in our popular culture.  He also offers conclusive evidence of the frightening real-world impact of these messages on our society and our children. Finally, Medved shows where and how Hollywood took a disastrous wrong turn toward its current crisis, and he outlines promising efforts both in and outside the industry to restore a measure of sanity and restraint to our media of mass entertainment.Sure to elicit strong response, whether it takes the form of cheers of support or howls of enraged dissent, Hollywood vs. America confronts head-on one of the most significant issues of our times.", "publisher": "Harper Perennial"}, {"id": "23e05a21-8df3-47f7-a108-9a50e5ac4e55", "title": "Shaken Not Stirred", "authors": ["By Miller, Anistatia R. and Brown, Jared M."], "year": "1997", "description": "This first-of-its-kind volume features 40 ways to make a classic martini, 60 nouveau concoctions and a directory of the world's best martini lounges.

Reed E. Hundt, chairman from 1993 to 1997 of the Federal Communications Commission, the nationâs chief regulatory agency for media and communications industries, tells of the battles for political advantage that lie behind the enormous creation of wealth and social changes that are generally called the âNew Economy.â The central theme of the narrative is the surprising passage and fascinating implementation of the 1996 Telecommunications Act, which authorized the Federal Communications Commission to replace monopoly with competition and to guarantee access to the Internet to all Americans, including every child in every classroom.Depending on the leadership of his high school classmate Al Gore and finding unexpected allies in the ranks of free market ideologues, Hundt led the FCC to make the decisions that helped start a wave of entrepreneurship, which in turn has given the United States the worldâs leading Internet economy. As the memoir shows, every decision involved prodigious political battlesâbetween existing industries and start-ups, between Newt Gingrich and the Clinton-Gore White House, between inside-the-Beltway lobbyists and the new grassroots advocacy of e-mails, between the politics of money and the politics of ideas. In the same period, the often ignored and historically maligned FCC was the place where government decided whether to undertake the largest national initiative to reform Kâ12 education in the countryâs history: the program to connect every classroom to the Internet by the year 2001.Hundtâs report from the political battlefield offers significant insight into the motives and personality not only of Al Gore but other prominent figures in political life, as well as many of the media moguls of our time.

Managed wisely, a strategic alliance can help companies develop and exploit their unique strengths. For example, a large company can break down the marketing barriers that face a small company, which in turn brings entrepreneurial creativity to the partnership. An alliance can also be a powerful tool for accessing new technology and developing domestic or international business opportunities.Yet many companies mismanage their alliances, leading to wasted money, time, and effort, sometimes with disastrous results. In Intelligent Business Alliances, consultant Larraine Segil shows how to establish and manage winning alliances, starting with the crucial process of picking the right partner and creating realistic expectations on both sides. Segil then explains how to analyze the corporate and individual personality types involved in an alliance, using her unique Mindshift approach, which can help managers forecast and avoid problems due to miscommunication or mismatched value systems.Based on the author's years of experience as an entrepreneur, attorney, and international consultant specializing in alliance strategies, Intelligent Business Alliances covers every important type of alliance, including partnerships, joint ventures, distribution deals, and equity investments.

Hypericum, or St. John's wort, as it is more commonly known, has emerged in Germany as one of the most popular, effective, and safe treatments for a devastating disease that affects millions:  depression. Now, for the first time, the worlds of conventional medicine and alternative healing have at last come together to embrace St. John's wort's exceptional powers. In St. John's Wort: The Herbal Way to Feeling Good, Norman Rosenthal, M.D., a leading authority in the field of depression and author of the bestselling Winter Blues, shows readers how they can relieve a host of different emotional conditions and difficulties accompanying the ordinary stresses of everyday life by tapping nature's own resources instead of using the pre-scription drugs that are now being taken by thousands of people worldwide. Written in an engaging, accessible manner and filled with fascinating anecdotes, the latest scientific research, and carefully documented case studies, St. John's Wort examines how extracts of this flower influence not only the brain chemical serotonin, which is also affected by such drugs as Prozac and Zoloft, but other critical brain chemicals as well. In addition, St. John's wortis easily accessible and can be purchased everywhere, from grocery stores to pharmacies;requires no prescription;costs a fraction of prescription medications;has no toxic effects;shows benefits after two weeks of treatmentGiven the widespread availability of this amazing herb and the prevalence of the conditions for which it has been proved so useful, the time is ripe for St. John's Wort, the comprehensive, authoritative, and accessible guide that will show readers how they can feel better quickly, safely, easily, and naturally.", "publisher": "HarperCol"}, {"id": "17e5374f-4ec8-4991-8bec-039e73f70498", "title": "Long Road to Freedom: The Advocate History of the Gay and Lesbian Movement (Stonewall Inn Editions)", "authors": ["By Thompson, Mark (EDT)"], "year": "1994", "description": "The emergence of the gay and lesbian community in the last quarter century has confronted America with what has become the new civil rights movement of the nineties, as millions of gay people assert their right to live as decent American citizens without the fear of persecution and discrimination.Since 1967 - two years before the Stonewall Riots, usually seen as the beginning of gay liberation - The Advocate has been the nations publication of record for the gay community. From its humble beginnings as a newsletter covering Southern California's homosexual subculture to its prominence today as a newsmagazine read around the world, The Advocate has mirrored the astonishing growth of the community it's served.Now the remarkable history of the modern gay and lesbian movement - a quarter century of rebellion and reform, tragedy and triumph - fills the hundreds of pages of news, photographs, essays, cartoons, and interviews culled from The Advocate.

Artisanal cheesemaker Margaret Prickett is struggling to save her centuries-old family farm. Suffering through a messy divorce and trying to raise her rebellious thirteen-year-old daughter, Polly, Margaret pins her farm's salvation on the sweeping amnesty Brooke promises America's independent farmers.

A woman from Keeney's Louisville church, Bobbie Roberts, confided that her twenty-year-old daughter Deana had recently died in a cliff fall at Big Sur, California. Bobbie was now having trouble collecting burial insurance. Keeney, a successful corporate lawyer, agreed to help her cut through the red tape.The coroner's report stated that a couple named B.J. and Virginia McGinnis had driven Deana to a four-hundred-foot Big Sur cliff. The McGinnises said that when their backs had been turned, the girl had fallen \"without a sound.\" Days after reading this report, Keeney was stunned to learn that Virginia had paid for a life insurance policy on Deana one day before the accident.Keeney suspected foul play, but Big Sur authorities quietly dropped the case: There were no witnesses other than the McGinnises. Undeterred, Keeney promised his client that he would try to find out the truth. A chilling portrait emerged.Virginia called herself a practical nurse, but people had dark memories of her \"care.\" They recalled her three-year-old daughter, her husband, and her mother - all of whom died while alone with Virginia. A series of fires, thefts, poisonings, and insurance policies ran through her past. Keeney also discovered that both of Virginia's sons had been charged with murder.As Keeney was piecing the facts together, he realized he had uncovered a remorseless killer, one who beat the system for twenty years, collecting insurance along the way.Former prosecutor David Heilbroner, author of the highly acclaimed book Rough Justice, spent two-and-a-half years retracing Keeney's investigation, preserving accounts of many witnesses whose voices were never heard at Virginia's extraordinary two-month murder trial - a trial that literally took the jury to the edge of the Big Sur cliff.

Whose power is it to declare war, to carry it out, and to sustain its course and bring it to an end? In addressing these major constitutional questions, Lehman is vibrantly contemporary, too, writing as a government insider to offer a exceptionally vivid perspective on Operation Desert Storm and recent military actions in Grenada, Libya, Lebanon, and Panama. Arguing vehemently for the primacy of presidential over congressional power, Lehman adds crucial new details to our understanding of the post-Vietnam era of American politics.Characteristically, Lehman pulls no punches. He sheds provocative new light on congressional investigations into Watergate and Iran-Contra, authoritatively demonstrating the ways in which Congress has created crippling impediments to presidential power. Yet he provides a fresh understanding of the essential role Congress must play in committing the nation to war, and he enumerates how presidents from Jefferson to Bush have interpreted--and misinterpreted--the powers grated them as commander in chief.John Lehman's enlightening new book makes a invaluable contribution as to whether responsible judgments will be made if and when the nation must again confront the crucial decision of making war.", "publisher": "Scribner"}, {"id": "b47f1f5a-3db2-4235-b74a-c1b6cb549db3", "title": "Beyond Survival: New Directions for the Disarmament Movement", "authors": ["By Albert, Michael (EDT) and Dellinger, Dave (EDT)"], "year": "1999", "description": "Nine political activists and journalists examine the connections between militarism, the economy and foreign policy, and the common roots of militarism, racism, sexism, and class oppression.", "publisher": "South End Press"}, {"id": "6aa2788d-d43a-4e65-a1a7-f988c1404c91", "title": "Surprise Party", "authors": ["By Katz, William"], "year": "1984", "description": "As she plans a birthday party for her husband, Samantha Shaw gradually learns that he is the deadly calendar murderer", "publisher": "McGraw-Hill"}, {"id": "a3c373e0-0487-402f-b3d1-94c90f36ee63", "title": "Real World Illustrator 8 (2nd Edition)", "authors": ["By McClelland, Deke and McClelland, Daniel"], "year": "1998", "description": "A thorough reference to design and production techniques using the popular graphics software.

Scott Fitzgerald lies partly in the fact that his tragic life was like the plots of his own novels. Many famous and brilliant writers have led withdrawn, prosaic, uneventful lives; but Fitzgerald and his wife, Zelda, existed almost wholly in the real, external world--active, social, sadly typical of that frantic time in which he experienced instant success and fame, followed by a long decline and failure. Arthur Mizener is well known as the author of the first full-scale biography of Fitzgerald. In this book, Professor Mizener looks at the facts of Fitzgerald's short life, offering insights into the subtle way in which actual events were transformed and woven into the novels. With the aid of contemporary photographs from all stages of Fitzgerald's career he tells the human story and provides an important assessment of Fitzgerald's achievement.", "publisher": "Thames & Hudson"}, {"id": "07eb7af8-204e-4605-980d-b3345e037330", "title": "The Research Universities and Their Patrons", "authors": ["By Rosenzweig, Robert M."], "year": "1982", "description": "America's research universities--some fifty leading intellectual centers--have assumed a unique set of responsibilities.

It began with the bombing of Saddam Husseinâs bunker and ended with statues of the Iraqi dictator being toppled in downtown Baghdad, and it marked a turning point in Americaâs relations with its enemies, its allies, and its sense of itself. Yet most Americans experienced the war as impressionistic and often confusingâthe story of one battle here, one unit there, a report from one city, then another, without the larger context we so urgently needed. Each reporter had his âsliceâ of the war, it seemed, but no one had the whole story or the broad view.A Time of Our Choosing fills that gap brilliantly, drawing on the unparalleled resources and reportage of The New York Times. Todd S. Purdum, one of the paperâs most gifted storytellers, traces the war in Iraq from the first rumblings after 9/11, to the diplomatic recriminations at the United Nations, to the battles themselves and their aftermath. He deftly rolls out the whole canvas before our eyes, showing how the individual âslicesâ fit together into a single, gripping drama.Purdum also explores the complex legacy of Americaâs near-unilateral action. Since the 9/11 attacks, President George W. Bush has vowed that the United States would confront its enemies âat a time of our choosing,â and Purdum shows in vivid terms what this choice has meant for our now transformed world.", "publisher": "Times Books"}, {"id": "6bb4f656-2a31-434c-b7ea-3cadeca8ad39", "title": "Rewriting History", "authors": ["By Morris, Dick and McGann, Eileen"], "year": "2004", "description": "Now, for the first time, Fox News political analyst and former Clinton adviser Dick Morris turns his sharp-eyed gaze on Hillary, the longtime First Lady, current New York senator, and bestselling author. For, as he argues, no politician in America today is better aligned to become president in 2008âand none would bring more baggage to the White Houseâthan Mrs. Clinton. In Rewriting History, Morris draws on his own long working relationship with the Clintons, as well as his trademark deep research and candid, nonpartisan analysis, to create a rebuttal to Hillary's bestselling autobiography, Living History. Morris documents how Hillary hides her true self behind a \"Hillary\" brand that is chatty, charming, giggly, and warmâbut is far from her true personality.In Rewriting History, Morris pierces the mask to get at the truth behind the distortions and omissions of Hillary's memoir. Here we meet the real Hillary, both good and bad: the manager who makes the trains run on time, but also the paranoid who sees all those who disagree with her as personal enemies; the idealist, but also the \"advice addict\" easily misled by the guru of the moment. Morris describes Hillary's sense of entitlement, and warns that it may lead deep into financial scandal. And he demonstrates how Hillary dodges criticism by pretending that every attack is directed not just at her, but at every working woman in America. Ultimately, Morris argues, the Hillary Clinton of today is marketing a false front, obscuring both her wants and her assets behind the phony facade of a domestic Everywoman. But as she pursues higher office, she also faces a choice. Will she, like Bobby Kennedy, see the error of her ruthless ways, and embrace the sincere idealism she professes? Or, like Richard Nixon, will she allow the darker angels of her nature to overcome her, jeopardizing herself and the country in the process?As Rewriting History suggests, we can only hope that Hillary Clinton's past performance is no guarantee of future results.", "publisher": "Harper"}, {"id": "b515251e-5db7-4646-a873-90f3e28f4a77", "title": "Girls!

From rap stars such as Queen Latifah to bands such as Velocity Girls, popular music has been aggressively redefined by a new generation of women, with a startling range of musical styles. Yet, women's role in contemporary music, and in music history, extends far beyond MTV or the latest riot grrrl troupe. In Girls! Girls!

Whether in the form of Helen Kolawole's discussion of the bitch- bashing misogyny of gangsta rap or Caroline Sullivan's exuberant assessment of women rock critics, the volume raises, and addresses, some of the most provocative and challenging issues concerning women's active involvement in and relationship to music.

He tackled Kiawah Island's diabolical and breathtaking Ocean Course with a party of well-heeled Southern gents. He tromped through sagebrush roughs and kikuyu bunkers in the Nevada outback. He encountered the ghost of a cherished golfing buddy during a memorable round in the Smokies.

In providing at least partial answers to these questions, Lincoln and Slavery gives us a fresh look at a subject often shadowed by misinformation.  Here, we follow the young Lincoln as he takes an interest in the law and becomes a legislator. In a series of debates with his political opponent Stephen Douglas, we hear Lincoln argue forcefully that slavery, if allowed to spread, would destroy democracy.  As Lincoln and Slavery focuses on Lincoln's years as president, we see him work on the Emancipation Proclamation -- which changed the purpose of the Civil War and welcomed black men into military service. We go with him to Gettysburg, where he reaffirms \"the proposition that all men are created equal.\" We listen to him, only weeks before his death, as he proclaims that the Union armies will keep fighting \"until every drop of blood drawn with the lash, shall be paid for by another drawn with the sword.\"  This is the story of a great American, a man who hated slavery and believed, above all else, that democracy was the best hope for humankind -- in his time and in all the years to come.", "publisher": "Atheneum Books for Young Readers"}, {"id": "68e1f969-6f27-4e6b-bdb3-eb75986597db", "title": "William Faulkner: First Encounters", "authors": ["By Brooks, Cleanth"], "year": "1985", "description": "In this clear-sighted and enjoyable book, Cleanth Brooks, acknowledged to be \"the best critic of our best novelist,\" introduces the general reader to Faulkner&#39;s most important novels and stories: The Sound and the Fury; As I lay Dying; The Hamlet; Go Down, Moses; Light in August; and Absalom, Absalom!Â  Brooks focuses on theme, character, and plot as well as on Faulkner&#39;s worldâthe fictional Yoknapatawpha County that provides a unique setting for Faulkner&#39;s tragicomic vision.", "publisher": "Yale University Press"}, {"id": "43898d94-3aa1-4557-bd07-6682f90bf8f2", "title": "Feminism and Psychoanalytic Theory", "authors": ["By Chodorow, Nancy J."], "year": "1991", "description": "In this long-awaited book, a leading psychoanalytic feminist traces the development of her views on the psychodynamics, sociology, and culture of gender.

Those coming to Mac OS X from previous incarnations of the operating system recognize much of the friendly face of the Macintosh but they are also plunged into a whole new world. Unix converts to Mac OS X find a familiar FreeBSD-like operating system at the core and many of the command-line applications that they're familiar with.This presents a unique opportunity for combining traditional Unix hacking and Mac OS know-how.  Mac OS X Hacks goes beyond the peculiar mix of man pages and not-particularly-helpful Help Center, pulling the best tips, tricks, and tools from the Mac power users and Unix hackers themselves.The collection reflects the real-world know how and experience of those well steeped in Unix history and expertise, sharing their no-nonsense, sometimes quick-and-dirty solutions to administering and taking full advantage of everything a Unix desktop has to offer: Web, Mail, and FTP serving, security services, SSH, Perl and shell scripting, compiling, configuring, scheduling, networking, and hacking.  Add to that the experience of die-hard Macintosh users, customizing and modifying their hardware and software to meet their needs: System Preferences, GUI mods and tweaks, hardware tips, vital shareware and freeware, AppleScript, AppleTalk and equivalents, keyboard modifiers, and general Macintosh-style tomfoolery.Each Hack can be read easily in a few minutes, saving countless hours of searching for the right answer.

The TRUTH behind the legend!  That Kinky Friedman... Where did he come from? How did he get that way? Shouldn't someone have called 911 long ago?   Now, in Blast from the Past, nationally bestselling author Kinky Friedman has searched his failing memory and has come up with a novel about his early days in New York City and how Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed country music performer, became Kinky Friedman, the down-and-out star-crossed ace detective.  In this prequel to his earlier novels, one which gives new meaning to the term \"retro,\" Kinkster fans are given the definitive answer to two of literature's great burning questions: Where the hell did those weird characters come from anyway? And what about that puppet head?  Of course, it's not just Kinky himself who gets retroed, but all the Village Irregulars as well -- Ratso, Rambam, and McGovern -- who are glimpsed in the nascent stage, as is the ever-luscious Stephanie DuPont, who blasts upon the scene as a five-year-old nymphet in patent-leather spikes.   Imagine it's the '70s. Imagine the Lone Star Cafe is still alive and well. Imagine that it's still okay to do drugs, still okay to have unprotected sex, still okay to paddle a brat and spank a monkey. And imagine you are there, in the '70s, at the Lone Star, sipping a brew with the Kinkster, a much younger, even kinkier Kinky -- uncouth, unshaped, unrepentant, and frequently unconscious.  But lest you think that Blast from the Past is all nostalgia, be assured that Kinky has supplied a bang-up plot as well, much of which revolves around the mystery of who this guy Tim is who Judy exclaims about while being hosed by Kinky, and the question of whether or not the Feds have found Abbie Hoffman, who has been playing hide-and-seek in Ratso's apartment. Or something like that.  As always, it's great, unpredictable fun from a true original, whose \"Irreverent, bawdy and often outrageous adventures are like no others,\" as says The San Diego Union-Tribune.

What began as a conflict in Europe, when Germany unleashed a lightning assault on its enemies, soon spread to North America, as a long-simmering hatred between two independent nations explodes. Twice in fifty years the Confederate States of America has humiliated their northern neighbor. Now revenge may at last be at hand.Under the leadership of Teddy Roosevelt, and following a general named Custer - military genius or madman? - the United States are fighting a war on two fronts in 1917. In the north, from the Pacific to Quebec, U.S. forces in the air and on land are locked in battle against Canada and Great Britain. To the south, at the heart of a line that stretches from the Gulf of California to the Atlantic, Custer intends to do what none of his predecessors had ever managed: to smash through the Confederate barbwire entrenchments in Tennessee.Here are leather-jacketed daredevil pilots flying unproved fighters into anti-aircraft fire. Here is a melee on the sea, as U.S. sailors duel Confederate submariners, while the English, French, and Japanese surface navies vie for control of the shipping lanes.

The first American to conduct at La Scala (Cherubini'sMedea in 1953 with Maria Callas), and the first to take over a major American orchestra when he became Music Director of the New York Philharmonic in 1958, he gave a new respectability to the idea of the American-born-and-trained musician. As Tim Page wrote in Newsday after Bernstein's death, Bernstein's decision to make a career in America was \"a declaration of independence\" for his generation of American musicians.In Conversations About Bernstein, friends, critics, and collaborators, as well as the world-class musicians who shared the stage with Bernstein, remember the private artist behind the public flamboyance and acclaim. In an unprecedented series of interviews with author William Westbrook Burton, they reveal how Bernstein worked, the perennial conflicts in his personal and professional lives, and why he made the choices that he did. Here are not only the great triumphs--the stunning debuts as conductor with the New York or the Vienna Philharmonics, the rapturous reception of the incomparableWest Side Story--but the moments of self-doubt and crushing disappointment as well. Composer Lukas Foss remembers Bernstein as a preternaturally poised young student under pressure to work in his father's beauty parlor business. FormerNew York Times critic Harold Schonberg maintains that his unrelentingly negative reviews of Bernstein's performances made no difference to Bernstein's career. Carol Lawrence recreates the historic first production ofWest Side Story. Conductor John Mauceri recalls with deep affection Bernstein's sometimes maddening methods of conducting and composing, and members of Bernstein's orchestras as well as opera stars Christa Ludwig, Frederica Von Stade, Jerry Hadley, and renowned cellist Mstislav Rostropovich share recollections of memorable recordings and performances.A portrait emerges of a remarkably generous conductor and musical theatre collaborator adored worldwide, who nonetheless believed at the end of his life that his single most cherished ambition--the creation of a serious masterwork--remained unrealized. Candid, entertaining, and often moving, Conversations About Bernstein is a deeply enjoyable look at the career of arguably the most famous musician of our time.", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}, {"id": "4bbffed7-1506-4289-89ea-81e732f78b6e", "title": "Secret Language of the Soul: A Visual Exploration of the Spiritual World", "authors": ["By Hope, Jane"], "year": "1997", "description": "The latest in the Secret Language series, The Secret Language of the Soul is an inspiring survey of faith and ritual through the ages, from Native American vision quests to chakras, avatars, and archangels.

Now he draws on his experience to offer an original explanation of America's role in the world and the problems facing the nation today and in the future.        Using colorful vignettes and up-close reporting from his coverage of the first two post-Cold War presidents, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush, Hirsh argues that America has a new role never before played by any nation: it is the world's Uberpower, overseeing the global system from the air, land, sea and, increasingly, from space as well. And that means America has a unique opportunity do what no great power in history has ever done--to perpetuate indefinitely the global system it has built, to create an international community with American power at its center that is so secure it may never be challenged. Yet Americans are squandering this chance by failing to realize what is at stake. At the same time that America as a nation possesses powers it barely comprehends, Americans as individuals have vulnerabilities they never before imagined. They desperately need the international community on their side.      In an era when democracy and free markets have become the prevailing ideology, Hirsh argues, one of America's biggest problems will be \"ideological blowback\"--facing up to the flaws and contradictions of its own ideals. Hence, for example, the biggest threat to political stability is not totalitarianism, but the tricky task of instituting democracy in the Arab world without giving Islamic fundamentalists the reigns of power. The only way for Washington to avoid accusations of hypocrisy is to allow the global institutions it has built, like the U.N., to do the hard work of promoting U.S. values.", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}, {"id": "dc23f048-92c6-4b1a-a98a-e9761ef2c305", "title": "Nijinski", "authors": ["By Brighton, Catherine"], "year": "1989", "description": "Describes how the renowned Russian ballet dancer found an outlet for his childhood unhappiness through dance and was eventually called to perform for the Tsar", "publisher": "Doubleday Books for Young Readers"}, {"id": "734a6be9-89bf-4b39-8a21-dc9dce33011a", "title": "The Illustrated Lark Rise to Candleford: A Trilogy by Flora Thompson", "authors": ["By Thompson, Flora and Shuckburgh, Julian"], "year": "1983", "description": "Autobiographical accounts of country life in late nineteenth-century England, chronicle the disappearing traditions and values of hamlet, village, and small market towns", "publisher": "Crown Publishers, Inc."}, {"id": "41aeb309-b912-4bba-aa99-751323a78143", "title": "Solving Patient Problems: Ambulatory Care (Clerkship Series)", "authors": ["By Bowman, Marjorie A.

In this entertaining book, be tells the story of his extraordinary life in baseball and offers provocative insights into the game's past, present, and future.The box score? The most complete player of his time has given us the complete baseball book, from the grit of the infield dirt on his spikes as he turned a double play against a charging Frank Robinson to no-holds-barred banter in the locker room with Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, and Pete Rose, from the frustration of seeing good teams destroyed by racism and incompetence to the triumph of winning it all with the most talented, and the smartest, team in baseball, Cincinnati's Big Red Machine.In vivid anecdotes, Joe Morgan recounts starting out in the minor leagues in the still-segregated South, the only black player on the Durham Bulls; earning a trip to the majors with the expansion Colt 45s (soon to become the Houston Astros), a rag tag collection of over-the-hill veterans and inexperienced youngsters with its own band of outlaws, \"The Dalton Gang\"; honing his game with the help of all-time-great Nellie Fox; competing against the likes of Willie Mays, Sandy Koufax, Bob Gibson, Tom Seaver, Reggie Jackson, Willie McCovey, and Willie Stargell; winning back to back MVP awards and World Series; dramatic seasons with the Philadelphia Phillies, San Francisco Giants, and Oakland A's; and being welcomed into the Hall of Fame by his childhood idol, Ted Williams.At the heart of the book is the tale of how four big, combative egos - Johnny Bench, Tony Perez, Pete Rose, and Morgan himself - learned to win together under Sparky Anderson's leadership, transforming the Cincinnati Reds into the Big Red Machine, the most successful team of the 1970s. Joe Morgan shows us how the Reds dominated games with sheer baseball smarts as well as awesome physical skill, and he gives us up-close views of his teammates, including Sparky Anderson's gift for molding individuals into a team dedicated to winning, Johnny Bench's flair for the dramatic play, Tony Perez's unquenchable will-to-win in the clutch, and Pete Rose's tumultuous experiences on and off the field. It's all here, from the day Dave Concepcion took a ride in the locker room dryer to George Foster's reply to an accusation of cheating: \"I don't cork my bat. I cork my arm.\"Bringing his unparalleled feel for winning baseball right up to the present, Morgan also gives us hard-hitting commentary on the current state of the game, discussing why today's teams play brain dead, what keeps Rickey Henderson and other stars from being as great as they think they are, why good teams self-destruct so easily, why the new commissioner will find it hard to act \"in the best interests of baseball,\" and how baseball ought to deal with such issues as expansion, free agency, and minority hiring. His controversial prescription for baseball's future - the appointment of a baseball ambassador empowered to negotiate with both players and owners for the good of the game - will spark lively debate all through the season and beyond.The final tally: here is a baseball read with the spark that made Joe Morgan the winningest player of his time.", "publisher": "W W Norton & Co Inc"}, {"id": "be56d53a-c38f-457b-9bbb-50017971775f", "title": "King of the Gypsies", "authors": ["By Maas, Peter"], "year": "1975", "description": "Chronicles Gypsy life in the United States today, centering on the still unresolved struggle for leadership between Steve Tene, grandson of the late King Tene Bimbo, and his embittered, vengeful father", "publisher": "The Viking Press"}, {"id": "de42fcb7-f8b4-4a06-a70f-ea1ff3de2e14", "title": "Hot Hips and Fabulous Thighs: Look Great in Just 6 Weeks", "authors": ["By Darden, Ellington"], "year": "1991", "description": "Suggests a program of exercise and dieting designed to trim and tone the stomach and lower body, shares healthful recipes, and offers advice on weight maintenance", "publisher": "Taylor Trade Publishing"}, {"id": "d7478041-37b7-4f9d-a221-51d1ae360545", "title": "Deserts: Miracle of Life", "authors": ["By Flegg, Jim"], "year": "1993", "description": "Combining a thoroughly knowledgeable, nontechnical text with 80 color photographs, Flegg examines all of the world's major desert types and areas.

The first section of this major new biography deals with the history of Wallace and his time. According to legend, born and brought up in Elderslie, Wallace's courage and heroism during Scotland's darkest days were instrumental in creating a sense of national identity. From the early killing of the Sheriff of Lanark, Sir William Haslerigg, through his crowning triumph at Stirling Bridge to his terrible end, Wallace was unswerving in his devotion to the cause of Scottish freedom. The brutality of his end is a testament to the fear and humiliation his name inspired in Edward I.The second section of the book studies the impact of the man and the myth on later generations. The guerrilla tactics initiated by Wallace were later used by Robert the Bruce to great success. Blind Harry's epic poem (1478) personifies the will and desire of Scottish people for independence in the figure of Wallace. Over 200 years after his death Scotland's greatest knight continues to inspire nationalists in this country and throughout the world.Peter Reese's objective and lucid text concludes with the judgement that Wallace's martyrdom was a greater legacy to the Scots than even the achievements of his lifetime. While he was alive, the power of his personality galvanised a nation. Since his death, the memory of William Wallace has endured as an inspiration for unity.", "publisher": "CAN"}, {"id": "34f31369-cc4b-4eef-a354-ae7997fb0d9d", "title": "Tabloid Dreams: Stories", "authors": ["By Butler, Robert Olen"], "year": "1996", "description": "In his first collection since the Pulitzer Prize-winning A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain, Robert Olen Butler dazzles anew with his mastery of the short-story form and his true empathy for the denizens of the less-well-explored corners of the human condition.

If we stop working for the cheese at the end of the maze, for the biggest toys at the end of the day, who knows what we could accomplish or how we might feel? This little book is nothing less than a game plan for creating a life that counts.In the tradition of Robert Fulghum, \"The Little Secret That Can Change Your Life\"* is a collection of short inspirational essays designed to help readers discover the path to a more meaningful life, one that is less about running the modern rat race of workaholism, consumerism, debt, and frustration. The book suggests that a more rewarding way of living comes when we realize that beneath the surface of life is a spiritual economy made up of virtues and values. Money and material things matter, but they aren't everything. We must be careful not to gain the world and lose our souls.\"Our inner world is ours to make of what we choose. Magnificent changes can radiate out of every human heart if we so desire. So then, if you are open, brave, and willing to take the challenge, read on. See if you don't agree that there's much more to life than winning the rat race.\"If every person who reads this book chooses one way to leave the rat race and passes the idea to just one other person, in no time at all our national priorities could change. Children could become more important than money. Virtue could become its own reward. Corporate greed could become passe.There are rules for rats -- Bite off more than you can chew.

The needle scarring from her diabetes drove away the only boy ever to care for her. Now she has retreated inside herself, determined never to be hurt again.Both of them have discovered Killobyte, an exciting new fantasy adventure game that promises to be the most realistic experience they can imagine. Once again Walter can have the strong legs of a hero, charging through a castle to rescue a captive princess, battling a ferocious dragon, matching wits with a sorcerer. With her face hidden behind a fictional character, Baal can forget her shyness and her fear that others will shrink away from her because of her lifetime of illness. She can laugh and have adventures, and dare to care about someone else again.But Killobyte is more real than even its creators can have dreamed. Within its programming lurks a flaw that has allowed one demented player a kind of power its creators never intended - a power that can trap and \"kill\" Walter and Baal time after time in the game scenarios.Of course, as long as this game of cat and mouse is kept within the world of computer-generated adventures, it's only a frustration. Walter and Baal seem never to win. But as the games continue, they begin to wonder whether the power of this mystery player can extend outside the framework of the game....The mystery player is out for power - and the power he has in mind is far more than just racking up points against fictional opponents.

But on a cool summer morning when Alison was fifteen, she woke to learn that Roy, eighteen, was dead. This is Smith's extraordinary account of the impact of that loss -- on herself, on her parents, and on a deeply religious community.At home, Alison and her parents sleepwalk in shifts. Alison hoards food for her lost brother, hides in the backyard fort they built together, and waits for him to return. During the day, she breaks every rule at Our Lady of Mercy School for Girls, where the baffled but loving nuns offer prayer, Shakespeare, and a job running the switchboard. In the end, Alison finds her own way to survive: a startling and taboo first love that helps her discover a world beyond the death of her brother.An intimate book written in clear-eyed prose, Name All the Animals announces a brilliant new writer with a keen insight into the emotional life of the American family, the power of sibling love and loyalty, and the excruciating joy of first, forbidden love. Smith tells the story through her own fifteen-year-old eyes, with such expert pacing and narrative suspense that readers will find the book hard to put down.Heartbreaking but hopeful, this is ultimately a book less about loss than it is about love -- about the excitement and anguish of Alison's first love, about her parents' enduring romance, about a community's passion for its faith, and about a well-loved boy who dies too young.

As the host of the phenomenally successful Hannity & Colmes on the Fox News Channel and The Sean Hannity Show on ABC Radio, Hannity has won a wildly devoted fan base. Now he brings his plainspoken, take-no-prisoners style to the continuing War on Terror abroad -- and liberalism at home -- in Deliver Us from Evil.\"Evil exists,\" Hannity asserts. \"It is real, and it means to harm us.\" And in these pages he revisits the harsh lessons America has learned in confronting evil in the past and the present, to illuminate the course we must take in the future. Tracing a direct line from Adolf Hitler and Joseph Stalin through Saddam Hussein and Osama bin Laden, he reminds us of the courage and moral clarity of our great leaders. And he reveals how the disgraceful history of appeasement has reached forward from the days of Neville Chamberlain and Jimmy Carter to corrupt the unrepentant leftists of the modern Democratic Party -- from Howard Dean and John Kerry to Bill and Hillary Clinton. As Americans face the ongoing war against terrorists and their state sponsors around the world, Sean Hannity reminds us that we must also cope with the continuing scourge of accommodation and cowardice at home. With his trademark blend of passion and hard-hitting commentary, he urges Americans to recognize the dangers of putting our faith in toothless \"multilateralism\" when the times call for decisive action.

This was the question put to the librarians of The New York Public Library as part of the Library's 100th anniversary celebration. Which books had influenced the course of events for good or ill? Which interpreted new worlds? Or delighted millions of readers? Their answers to these questions formed \"Books of the Century,\" a highly popular exhibit during the Library's centennial celebration (1895 to 1995), highlighting an exhilarating collection of important works by some of the greatest writers of our times.     Now, the companion volume, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century takes readers on a thought-provoking tour of the last hundred years, through the medium of the printed word. Here readers will find over 150 pivotal works organized into topical categories, reflecting themes that have informed the century, among them \"Mind & Spirit,\" \"Protest & Progress,\" \"Women Rise,\" or \"Nature's Realm.\" Each is introduced with a brief commentary illuminating the themes and issues the books in that section address, followed by an annotation for each title offering a brief description and a key to its significance.  The range of books is remarkable, embracing Chekhov's Three Sisters and Bram Stoker's Dracula, as well as Galbraith's The Affluent Society and Durkheim's Suicide, or Timothy Leary's The Politics of Ecstasy and W.E.B. Du Bois's The Souls of Black Folk. Readers will find many illuminating juxtapositions. In \"Utopias & Dystopias,\" for instance, The Wonderful Wizard of Oz, Peter Pan, and Lost Horizon are in the unexpected company of Nineteen Eighty-four, A Clockwork Orange, Brave New World, and The Time Machine. The century's darkest moments are mirrored in \"War, Holocaust, Totalitarianism,\" where we find Koestler's Darkness at Noon, Hersey's Hiroshima, Anne Frank's Diary, and Dee Brown's Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee. But the volume ends on a happier note, with \"Optimism, Joy, Gentility,\" and such wonderful works as Helen Keller's The Story of My Life, Shaw's Pygmalion, Margaret Wise Brown's Goodnight Moon, and Harper Lee's To Kill a Mockingbird.      Illustrated throughout with imaginative paper cut-out murals by artist Diana Bryan, The New York Public Library's Books of the Century is a reflection of our times, featuring both the books we love--whether The Cat in the Hat or Ulysses--and books like The Surgeon General's Report or Mein Kampf that, for better or worse, have been an inescapable part of our century. \"For 100 years, the librarians of The New York Public Library have shared our passion for books with a diverse and literate public,\" said curator and editor Elizabeth Diefendorf. \"That experience has given us a unique perspective in making our choices for the books of the century. We hoped that visitors to the exhibition, and now the readers of this book, will be drawn into our choices and reflect on what their own selections would be.\"", "publisher": "Oxford University Press"}, {"id": "e36d3ba6-398e-463d-925f-26552b1f9028", "title": "Quiltmakers of Australia: Celebrating the Traditions", "authors": ["By Fail, Karen"], "year": "1996", "description": "Quiltmaking is experiencing a worldwide revival.

Creatively edited, with insightful introductory material, this timely reader illuminates the historical development of feminist theory as well as the current state of the field.Emphasizing common themes and interests in the humanities and social sciences, the editors have chosen those topics that have been central to feminist theory in many disciplines, that remain relevant to current debates, and that reflect the interests of a diverse community of thinkers.The contributors include leading figures from psychology, literary criticism, sociology, philosophy, anthropology, art history, law, and economics. This is the ideal text for any advanced course on interdisciplinary feminist theory, one that fills a long-standing gap in feminist pedagogy.", "publisher": "Routledge"}, {"id": "ef049cfb-cacd-49b6-a638-c0c880db31ab", "title": "Turning Life into Fiction", "authors": ["By Hemley, Robin"], "year": "1994", "description": "With lively style, good humor and insight, Robin Hemley helps you turn all that you experience into fresh and powerful fiction.By learning to \"reimagine,\" you'll focus on translating real-world people and events into characters and scenes that happen on paper for the first time. You'll think \"what if\" instead of \"what is\" in order to take control of your material and cut loose the inhibitions of real life.In these pages, you'll learn how to hone your observation skills and fill your journal with rich and vivid details. (Because, as Hemley writes, \"Life is in the details, and so is good fiction.\") You'll see how to decide which ideas to bring to fiction and which ones to let go. And you'll learn how to: find the right form - novel, short story, vignette, memoir - for the story you want to tell; use \"triggers\" to start your reader's imagination rolling; keep your fiction emotionally honest by making the right choices between \"the way it happened\" and what the story dictates (ask \"Is it believable?\", not \"Did it happen?\"); create composites of real people and places that fit the unique needs of your story and empower your imagination; focus your fiction. Make sure everything, every character counts - and eliminate \"people who sit at the end of the bar without a role to play\"; fictionalize - ethically and legally - other people's stories. Learn your rights as a writer versus their rights to privacy. (Can you use actual names? When do you need to get permission?)To illustrate how writers feed their fiction with reality, Hemley uses examples from his own work and from fiction masters of yesterday and today. At the end of each chapter, challenging exercises help you apply the basic theories and push them even further.An adventurous read, Turning Life Into Fiction will help you create fiction that's just as strange and wonderful and \"real\" as the life that inspires it.", "publisher": "Story Press"}, {"id": "4b5492ab-b58d-4146-979b-0d0a69022def", "title": "Foundations of Epidemiology", "authors": ["By Lilienfeld, A.

Article ideas are everywhere - but often buried, like mountains under molehills. McKinney helps you unearth yours and advises you in matching it to a magazine. And he shows you how to sell your article - before writing it - by creating a query letter sure to catch an editor by the imagination and intellect.Once you've got the nod, you'll talk to people and dig up information. Keeping the interview on track; the tape-or-notebook question; probing sensitive areas - McKinney helps you make these conversations count. He also ushers you into the library and to reference publications that will put you on the trail to facts you need. And he gives you an overview of computer databases and what's available on-line and on CD-ROM. Talk about saving time.And then, ready with the fruits of your research, armed with supporting comments, it's time to write. This book helps you by taking you into the very core of good wordsmithing. You'll learn about:Leads - the four basic functions your opening should serve, and four general categories of effective leads. You'll see how to grab your reader and yank him into your story. And how others, including E.B. White, Dave Barry and Frank DeFord, have done that.Endings - how to close your piece so that it rings in the reader's mind. You'll analyze ten types of finishes that McKinney identifies. Listen to the resonance in the samples of work by Shana Alexander, Saul Pett, John McPhee, Rex Reed and others.Structure - how to pound and knead and shape the agglomeration of information you've collected into a well-told tale. You'll learn about four types of article structure. And you'll see how, once you've got your story's elements in their proper places, to snug them up with transitions that make the reading smooth.Sparkle - that certain something that makes your writing stand out. Explore it, learn its ingredients through McKinney's narrative; watch it at work in the examples by W.C. \"Bill\" Heinz and Joan Didion and others. You'll see what separates average writing from good writing. This book will help you grasp it.In fact, this book will help you find your writing way in many ways, large and small.One of the larger ways is through a chapter devoted to helping you write the ever popular human-interest piece. You'll find out what kinds of articles editors seek - and why, if you meet someone with a true-drama tale, you should get the story and speed your query.Another chapter puts you onto, in McKinney's words, \"articles that anyone can write.\" You may have a wealth of material suitable for major magazines, right now, awaiting only your concentration and your fingers on the keys.Throughout this book, you'll find great writing examples. And in the back are profiles of accomplished magazine writers, including Maxine Rock, Barbara Raymond and Bil Gilbert; you'll gain a wealth of instruction through these essays.

Technology has been the blessing and the bane of the twentieth century. Human lifespan has nearly doubled in the West, but in no century have more human beings ever been killed by new technologies of war. Improvements in agriculture have fed increasing billions, but pesticides and chemicals threaten to poison the Earth.  Does technology improve us or diminish us? Enslave us or make us free? The problems and paradoxes of technology have stirred impassioned debate, yet, despite the central role technology has played in this century, Visions of Technology is the first book to explore the rich diversity of commentary about this vital subject.  Guided by the eminent Richard Rhodes, the reader of this provocative treasury will find highlighted the views of such prominent technological figures as Henry Ford, H. G. Wells, Rachel Carson, Margaret Sanger, Aldous Huxley, John Glenn and Gordon E. Moore. Visions of Technology also features thought-provoking images -- from the first X ray to R. Crumb's comic apocalypse -- which inform this original, much-needed roundtable.

William F. Buckley, Jr., was raised a Catholic. As the world plunged into war, and as social mores changed dramatically around him, Buckley's faith -- a most essential part of his make-up -- sustained him. In Nearer, My God, Buckley examines in searching detail the meaning of his faith, and how his life has been shaped and sustained by religious conviction.In highly personal terms, and with the wit and acuity for which he is justly renowned, Buckley discusses vital issues of Catholic doctrine and practice, and in so doing outlines for the reader both the nature of CathoLic faith and the essential role of religious belief in everyday life. In powerfully felt prose, he contributes provocatively and intelligently to the national interest in the nature of religion, the Church, and spiritual development. Nearer, My God is sure to appeal to all readers who have felt the stirrings of their own religious faith, and who want confirmation of their beliefs or who are seeking a guide to understanding their own souls. The renowned social and political commentator, William F. Buckley Jr., turns to a highly personal subject -- his faith. And he tells us the story of his life as a Catholic Christian. \"Nearer, My God\" is the most reflective, poignant, and searching of Bill Buckley's many books. In the opening chapters he relives his childhood, a loving, funny, nostalgic glimpse into pre-World War II America and England. He speaks about his religious experiences to a world that has changed dramatically. He is unafraid of revealing the most personal side of his faith. He describes, in his distinctive style, the intimacy of a trip to Lourdes, the impact on him of the searing account by Maria Valtorta of the Crucifixion, the ordination of his nephew into the priesthood, and gives a moving account of his mother's death. And there is humor, as Buckley gives a unique, hilarious view of a visit to the Vatican with Malcolm Muggeridge, Charlton Heston, Grace Kelly, and David Niven. Personal though this book is, Buckley has gone to others to examine new perspectives, putting together his own distinguished 'Forum' and leaning on the great literature of the past to illustrate his thinking on contemporary Catholic and Christian issues.", "publisher": "Harper Paperbacks"}, {"id": "3d0f366c-d3e4-430a-8b7b-8376f0bcbd95", "title": "Rekindling the Flame: How Jews Are Coming Back to Their Faith", "authors": ["By Osherson, Samuel"], "year": "2002", "description": "Many Jewish men and women are creating a vibrant, enriched Judaism for our contemporary world.

These people are widening the doors of Judaism, creating new rituals, increasing openness to other religions, and moving this patriarchal religion toward one without authoritarian figures. And here, Osherson, beginning a new chapter in the long story of the survival of the Jewish people, has provided a handbook for Jews yearning to redefine their relationship with Judaism and seeking to rebuild the bridges between their religious and cultural heritage.

But just as threatening to their survival are obstacles erected by human politics, greed, corruption, folly, and hypocrisy. In this mesmerizing book, Beverly and Stephen Stearns tell the stories of people who have worked directly with disappearing species in Europe, Africa, North America, and Oceania. They are stories of passion and commitment, of competence and selflessness. They are also stories that alarm, for even as unheralded heroes are working to reverse what often seems to be a speciesâ inevitable march toward extinction, incompetent or self-interested parties are often working against them.The authors interviewed people who work with endangered species as diverse as Mediterranean monk seals, large blue butterflies, African wild dogs, native Hawaiian crows, Texas salamanders, and rare plants on Mauritius. These dedicated individuals, in discussing how they view their work, the problems they encounter, and their thoughts on the broader significance of extinction, reveal that the causes of extinction are unique to each speciesâsometimes subtle and complex, at other times obvious and simple. Yet an extinction always represents an irretrievable loss of evolutionary potential and a diminishing of the beauty, diversity, and value in our own lives.

His columns in Time magazine and his commentaries on PBS's News Hour with Jim Lehrer have made him a household word and a trusted friend of millions. With a wry sense of humor and inimitable wit, Rosenblatt offers here guidelines for aging that are both easy to understand and, more importantly, easy to implement.  More and more in the news today, we are hearing about phenomenal advances in the \"fight against aging.\" But what Rosenblatt suggests to combat age is far more valuable than any scientific breakthrough-he breaks down the hardest part of aging, the mental anguish of growing older with fifty-four gems of funny, brilliant, wise, indispensable advice. A book to savor, a book to keep, and a book for all ages.This little guide is intended for people who wish to age successfully, or at all. . . . One may think of this work as a how-to book, akin to many health guides published these days, whose purpose is to prolong our lives and make them richer. That is the aim of my book, too. -from the IntroductionAnd this is just the start of Roger Rosenblatt's charming and thought-provoking guide to surviving the episodes that shamelessly shave years off of our lives. With a wry sense of humor and peerless wit, Rules for Aging provides guidance that is, hands down, the most practical, pleasurable and, most importantly, painless advice you'll ever receive.

I mean only to say that you will suffer.\"Rule #1: It doesn't matterWhatever you think matters-doesn't. Follow this rule, and it will add decades to your life.

Whether it is a battlefield or the home of a notable American, there is no question that we understand the past in a different and more immediate way when we encounter it \"on the ground.\"     In American Places, more than two dozen of America's most gifted historians write about their own encounters with historic places, bringing a personal viewpoint to bear on a wide variety of sites, ranging from Monticello to Fenway Park. Here James M. McPherson writes about the battlefield of Gettysburg, and how walking the ground of Pickett's Charge inspired one of his books. Kevin Starr visits the Musso & Frank Grill in Hollywood and finds many of the flavors of California history there. Joel Williamson takes a bemused tour of Elvis Presley's Graceland, and David Kennedy tells the story of the \"Pig War\" of San Juan Island, where a spat between Britain and America over a speck of land in the Pacific helped determine the shape of the U.S. and Canada. William Freehling compares two places, Charleston's Battery and New Orleans' Jackson Square, showing how each reveals the different spirit of the society that created it. And Edward Ayers talks about spending time in Cyberspace, U.S.A., a virtual place that has much in common with the America visited by Alexis de Tocqueville a century and a half ago. Other pieces include Robert Dallek on the FDR Memorial, David Hackett Fischer on the Boston Common, and William Leuchtenburg on his native borough of Queens.

We have fought for many reasons:  independence, national unity, manifest destiny, international democracy.  Americans have fought in almost every corner of the world, from deserts to mountains to jungles.  And in every war on every front, we have paid intense attention.  Typewriter patriots, equipped with telegraphs, radio microphones, or satellite links, have been the conduit for a public eager to imagine and feel every musket fire and missile blast from Lexington to Baghdad.   In Dispatches from the Front we have unique and special dispatches from ten American wars.  In the correspondents' words ring the passion and drama of war from the American Revolution to the Persian Gulf War.  The work of Thomas Paine, Stephen Crane, Ernest Hemingway, Ernie Pyle, Edward R. Morrow, Sydney Schanberg, and more than sixty other correspondents tell us of America's wars as they happened, on the battlefield and on the home front.  Brief essays introduce each war by discussing the important changes taking place in American society and providing a series of \"national snapshots\" of the economic, political, and technological character of the world and the country at the time.  The impact of these factors on each episode of warfare is considered, followed by a focus on the experiences of the war itself.   Over the years, the words of press observers have been central in fostering wartime nationalism.  Reporters functioned as frontline poets, scratching the first impressions into the culture's consciousness. The tone and character of the press coverage shaped the nation's understanding of itself.

Distressed by the divisive impact of modern identity politics, Diggins argues persuasively that in the central tenets of Lincolnâs political faith--the redeeming value of labor and the rights to property and self-determination--we find the purest expression of the values that have united Americans and guided American history.With his characteristic breadth, Diggins ranges from James Madison to W. E. B. Du Bois to the movie Good Will Hunting in his examination of the often ambivalent ways in which Americans have imagined themselves and their nation.

That was nearly a hundred years after the election of the first African American man to Congress and fifty years after the first woman. A quarter of a century after Chisholm's election, the first Black woman, Carol Moseley-Braun, was elected to the United States Senate. It was not until 1993, when ten additional Black women won seats in the 103rd Congress, that African American women were allowed to serve their country and their constituencies in any substantial numbers. In 1997 that historic moment will very likely be lost as congressional districts are redrawn by court order. This remarkable book by LaVerne Gill preserves the history of the struggles and accomplishments of these fifteen courageous women, and will move others to learn from and follow their example.African American Women in Congress details the life and career histories of Shirley Chisholm, Barbara Jordan, Yvonne Burke, Cardiss Collins, Katie Hall, Eleanor Holmes Norton, Maxine Waters, Barbara-Rose Collins, Carol Moseley-Braun, Corinne Brown, Carrie Meek, Cynthia McKinney, Eva Clayton, Eddie Bernice Johnson, and Sheila Jackson-Lee. Each profile contains a picture of its subject, interview material, and resumÃ©s. Arranged chronologically, the book introduces the reader to issues of vital importance to the Black communityâReconstruction, enfranchisement, lynchings and harassment, civil rights struggles, the founding of advocacy groups, the power of the Congressional Black Caucus, the creation of majority minority districts that allowed greater representation in Congress, the struggle of largely Black Washington, D.C., for representation, and the recent dismantling of past gains by a Republican majority. Gill also describes the uphill battles for social justice and the rights of women that the fifteen women had to wage even within their own political parties, political organizations, and districts.For general readers, high school and college students, and anyone interested in the political process, this book is illuminating and inspiring reading.", "publisher": "Rutgers Univ Pr"}, {"id": "68bcd843-11da-4dd1-8765-fb9a07f0a78b", "title": "We Write for Our Own Time: Selected Essays from Seventy-Five Years of the Virginia Quarterly Review", "authors": ["By Burnham, Alexander (EDT)"], "year": "2000", "description": "In 1925, Edwin A. Alderman, president of the University of Virginia, fulfilled a long-held dream by establishing a magazine at the institution founded by Thomas Jefferson just over one hundred years earlier. Not only did Alderman initiate publication of the Virginia Quarterly Review, he contributed an essay to its inaugural issue.Appearing as the first selection in this new volume of nonfiction from the VQR, Alderman's \"Edgar Allan Poe and the University of Virginia\" reflects the rare combination of literary sensibility and immersion in the political and social issues of the day, which has characterized the journal throughout its seventy-five-year history. As Alderman writes, \"I may be frank and say that there was a time when Poe did not greatly appeal to me. I felt the sheer, clear beauty of his song..., but his detachment from the world of men, where my interests most centered, left me unresponsive and simply curious.... I have come, however, to see the limitations of that view, and to behold something admirable and strange and wonderful in this proud, gifted man.\"While the style and diction of the contributions have changed in the years since that first spring issue, a similar clarity of thought, deep intelligence, candor, and command of language can be found in every one of the fifty one essays assembled here by Alexander Burnham. From its home at One West Range, a few doors down from Poe's own room, the VQR has welcomed to its pages scholars such as Dumas Malone and Robert Coles, and writers whose books have become international bestsellers, including Arthur C. Clarke and Frances Mayes.Included here are some of the twentieth century's most brilliant thinkers and stylists, such international literary, political, and intellectual figures as Andre Gide, D. H. Lawrence, Aldous Huxley, Evelyn Waugh, T. S. Eliot, Eleanor Roosevelt, Thomas Mann, Jean-Paul Sartre, Bertrand Russell, and Robert Graves. George F. Kennan muses on \"The Experience of Writing History,\" Henry Steele Commager asks \"Do We Have a Class Society?,\" and Edmund S. Morgan considers the aloof character of George Washington. Carlos Baker tracks Ezra Pound through Venice, and Scott Donaldson ponders \"The Jilting of Ernest Hemingway.\" These leading lights share space, as they do in every volume of the journal, with lesser-known but no less talented writers ruminating on the Battle of the Bulge, the Berlin Wall, the Bomb, and Vietnam, on growing up in Hollywood and living in Charlottesville, Virginia.Writers of the South are fittingly represented by Thomas Wolfe, Mary Lee Settle, and Louis D. Rubin Jr., but a quick scan of the table of contents reveals that the VQR has never been a regional magazine. As the current editor, Staige D. Blackford writes in his preface, \"Since its inception, the Virginia Quarterly Review has tried to offer its readers a variety of essays on a variety of topics ranging from foreign affairs to domestic politics, from literature to travel, from sports to sex, from music to medicine.\"On the occasion of its seventy-fifth anniversary, We Write for Our Own Time amply and entertainingly reflects what the VQR's masthead has always proclaimed as its identity: \"A National Journal of Literature and Discussion.\"", "publisher": "University of Virginia Press"}, {"id": "c74ed056-ee05-4939-97cd-cebb23ccfc6c", "title": "The Great Land: Reflections on Alaska", "authors": ["By Hedin, Robert A.

The number of viewers who routinely watch the nightly news in Russia matches the number of Americans who tune in to the Super Bowl, thus making TV coverage the prized asset for which political leaders intenselyâand sometimes violentlyâcompete. In this revised and expanded edition of Changing Channels, Ellen Mickiewicz provides many fascinating insights, describing the knowing ways in which ordinary Russians watch the news, skeptically analyze information, and develop strategies for dealing with news bias.\t Covering the period from the state-controlled television broadcasts at the end of the Soviet Union through the attempted coup against Gorbachev, the war in Chechnya, the presidential election of 1996, and the economic collapse of 1998, Mickiewicz draws on firsthand research, public opinion surveys, and many interviews with key players, including Gorbachev himself. By examining the role that television has played in the struggle to create political pluralism in Russia, she reveals how this struggle is both helped and hindered by the barrage of information, advertisements, and media-created personalities that populate the airwaves. Perhaps most significantly, she shows how television has emerged as the sole emblem of legitimate authority and has provided a rare and much-needed connection from one area of this huge, crisis-laden country to the next. \tThis new edition of Changing Channels will be valued by those interested in Russian studies, politics, media and communications, and cultural studies, as well as general readers who desire an up-to-date view of crucial developments in Russia at the end of the twentieth century.", "publisher": "Duke University Press Books"}, {"id": "c4add9f5-726d-41a2-86e0-342e200e9fd9", "title": "American Spectator's Enemies List: A Vigilant Journalist's Plea for a Renewed Red Scare", "authors": ["By O'Rourke, P.

Crane reimagines the famous meeting between the two women years after Byron's death, a chillingly dramatic scene through which he explores the emotional and sexual truths that lay at the center of these tragic relationships. In the encounter between the two women - one in chronic ill health, the other dying - we have the ultimate display of their mutual obsession with the memory and compulsive influence of Byron that makes their story that of the Romantic Age itself.It is a story full of dubious motives, especially Annabella's \"saving\" of Augusta and her child, Medora, and her twisted revenge on them both. And as the curses of incest and abuse play themselves out in the fates of Byron's daughters, we see their lives assuming the shape of Greek tragedy.In the meeting of the two women and the consequences of their battle, Crane shows us the Romantic Age in its terrible collision with the new world of the Victorians.

He vowed to be the first to sail across the bay, and so began Aqua Star's sub-Arctic adventure.Sike and his wife, Carolann, whose sailing experiences went no further than dinghy lessons on Calgary's Glenmore Reservoir and correspondence courses on navigation, dedicated all of their energy and resources to making their unlikely dream come true.

In one of the first books to address the New German Cinema from a feminist perspective, Barbara Kosta looks closely at two autobiographical films; Helma Sanders-Brahms's Germany, Pale Mother and Jutta Bruckner's Years of Hunger, and at two books, Ruth Rehmann's Der Mann auf der Kanzel: Fragen an einen Vater (The man in the pulpit: Questions for a father,) and Wolf's Patterns of Childhood. In different ways, Kosta shows, these works of the 1970s and 1980s have recast traditional autobiography, offering fresh characters in new roles exploring innovative forms of expression, and confronting long-repressed themes such as the devaluation of the female voice and the horror of Germany's fascist past.Kosta perceives in autobiographies by German women a conflict between the need to accept their sociocultural heritage and the desire to uncover and respond to its destructive aspects. As they struggle to redefine relationships among family, history, and self, Wolf and Rehmann write of the psychic structures, that were shaped by a childhood under the Third Reich in their films, Sanders-Brahms and Bruckner, who grew up after the war, explore issues of gender relations as well as re-enacting German history.

As a lover, she risked the disgrace of adultery to conduct an affair that scandalized Europe; as a patron, she supported many of the leaders of the cultural renaissance; as a mother, she is the ancestor of most of the royal houses of Europe.In her superb new biography, Lisa Hilton chronicles the life of this extraordinary woman. She vividly describes Athenais's unhappy marriage to a gamester nobleman, her entry into the decadent and intricate world of court politics, and her brilliant seduction of France's most desired suitor, the King himself. Athenais transformed Louis from a shy, awkward young monarch into the polished Sun King of legend.Throughout the \"age Montespan,\" Athenais used her wit and beauty to stave off the intrigues of courtiers, the machinations of Versaille's clerics, and the wiles of lovely young pretenders to the King's heart - all doggedly seeking to unseat her. It was not until the Affair of the Poisons, a bizarre witch-hunt that uncovered conspiracy in the highest echelons of the nobility, that Athenais's hold on the King and court faltered. Though the mystery remains unsolved, Athenais's implication in the sinister dealings of sorcerers and poisoners caused a fall from grace almost as precipitous as her rise.", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company"}, {"id": "9e929dba-2efa-487b-bf04-43f361a8a975", "title": "Christmas Every Day", "authors": ["By Howells, William Dean, Evans, Richard Paul, and Dimarco, Gina (ILT)"], "year": "1996", "description": "\"'Here is a charming Christmas tale.

These papers, about women's ways of being in the world, frame an innovative relational perspective on women's psychological development. The authors--clinicians, clinical supervisors, and teachers--have been searching for therapeutic models that take into account women's meaning systems, values, and organization of experiences, all of which often revolves around relationships rather than the self. By offering a new perspective on women's development, WOMEN'S GROWTH IN CONNECTION stands at the forefront of the ongoing feminist movement to examine and reshape psychological theory and practice.

Why? Have we somehow fooled Mother Nature and escaped from the laws of evolution?Written like a detective story, this book brings together a wealth of new research from paleontology, genetics, and neurobiology to explain the runaway evolution of the human brain. Evolutionists and human paleontologists have tended to assume that our intellect began to burgeon when our ancestors developed the ability to walk upright, to grasp and carry objects, or to form cooperative groups for hunting. While these and many other factors are important, this book shows that they are only some of the latest steps in a long evolutionary story that began a billion years ago. By now, the brains of many different animals are much larger than those of their predecessors and are superbly adapted to environments that have slowly become more complex. But our own distant ancestors were the only ones to enter a new evolutionary path, a feedback loop that involved their brains, their bodies, and an ever more complicated environment that they largely created themselves. The result, for better and sometimes for worse, is our own astonishing species.The author shows how this view of our evolution as a runaway process casts light on a number of major questions that recent discoveries have raised about our past. These include the identity and true role of the mitochondrial Eve, the origin of human diversity, and the confusion and controversy surrounding our fossil record. Two major views of recent human evolution hinge on the time at which people like ourselves first arose. Did they do so in several different parts of the Old World, the so-called \"multiple origins\" model, or did they appear suddenly and recently, perhaps driving all the more primitive hominids to extinction? The first model is favored by many anthropologists; the second, by many geneticists. While it is not yet possible to decide with certainty between the two, the book details how the driving force of runaway brain evolution is so great that it can easily account for multiple origins.Turning to the evolution of the brain itself, the author recounts the escape of our ancestors from the \"stupidworlds\" of the past. He shows how, as a result of this escape, our brains have evolved into sponges for knowledge. They are so versatile, and have been driven by such strong evolutionary pressures, that fundamental human capabilities such as language can be traced to many different parts of the brain that have simultaneously increased in complexity. Using a vivid series of examples, the book details scientists' growing knowledge of the kinds of genetic changes that have powered the runaway process.Written by a scientist whose previous books have explored the whole sweep of evolution and the complexities of the human genome, The Runaway Brain casts a brilliant light on human intellect and human nature.", "publisher": "Basic Books"}, {"id": "7678f518-6029-495f-a8d1-488f6bd67abb", "title": "Frederic Remington: Selected Writings", "authors": ["By Remington, Frederic"], "year": "1986", "description": "Gathers illustrated stories and articles about the West, the life of the cowboy, and skirmishes between cavalry and the Indians, written by the successful painter", "publisher": "Castle, Book Sales"}, {"id": "060d9eab-ab8c-4cbd-ac44-b5b66372a3be", "title": "The Irony Of Virtue: Ethics And American Power", "authors": ["By Lefever, Ernest W."], "year": "1997", "description": "This definitive anthology is the fruit of one of Americaâs most respected neoconservatives. Trained in Christian ethics, Ernest Lefever has been an articulate public policy advocate. Both conservatives and liberals will ignore his views at their peril.In this first-ever anthology of his most important work, Lefever takes a bold and lively march through the second half of the twentieth century. As an acute participant-observer who cares deeply about peace, freedom, and human dignity, Lefever became a neoconservative twenty years before Irving Kristol coined the term. For this volume, Lefever selected forty of his most influential essays from some 500 published pieces. They reveal his dramatic transformation from a liberal pacifist during World War II to a humane realist.The earliest essays, from Lefeverâs Yale Divinity School days, recount his experience as a civil rights activist during World War II and as a relief worker in the POW camps of postwar Europe. Later essays assess such institutions as the United Nations and the World Council of Churches. Lefever tackles a myriad policy issues from nuclear testing and human rights to arms control and the collapse of communism. His essays on the Berlin Wall and his reappraisal of the Vietnam legacy confirm his skill at combining history, political theory, and opinion journalism.

The book reveals the high cost to the U.S. military of acute political instability in Eastern Europe, the economic impact on U.S. businesses of systemic corruption in East Asia, the serious worldwide environmental hazards of nuclear fuel leaks in Russia, the imminent threat of deadly viruses spreading from Africa, and even the expensive consequences of substandard prison conditions in the United States, to name some examples.

It was a year of extremes for an issue that seems to know no middle ground, and it is the polarizing quality of abortion as a policymaking dilemma that No Neutral Ground? seeks to address.One of the most heated and often violent issues of our time, abortion continues to challenge leaders, citizens, and policymakers alike. Is it a question of morality? Personal liberty? The right to privacy? Keeping the peace? What are the implications of the Supreme Courtâs rulings on abortion for future legislation? And what does it mean for every level of government when an issue defies consensus the way that abortion does?In her unique treatment of this complex subject, Karen OâConnor builds on the history of abortion as a political issueâhow it was first defined in the early 1800s and how it got on the political agendaâand takes us through the tug-of-war development of abortion politics to the present, using the policy process framework. Examining key court cases, institutions, dramatic events, and opinions from the public to the Supreme Court, OâConnor highlights the dilemma of how a polity attempts to make decisions about issues on which agreement or compromise is unlikely.

He takes us from the rough-and tumble early days (when one studio paid Pancho Villa $25,000 to launch his attacks only in daylight, after a film crew had set up) to the studio era (when Joan Crawford refused to cross the street on the MGM lot except in a chauffeured limousine) to the shenanigans of today's global industry.

For attorneys Gail Connor and Anthony Quintana, spending a couple of days in a private villa on a secluded island in the Florida Keys seems almost too good to be true. The innocent clichÃ© hits home with a vengeance when a dangerously unbalanced former client of Anthony's is suspected of a local murder, and then attempts suicide. As an idyllic vacation turns into an escalating nightmare of terror and death, Gail and Anthony find themselves isolated among the strange and secretive islanders as a late tropical storm threatens to unleash its fury on them all. Somehow, they must hang on to their sanity and use every weapon at their disposal to outwit a wily criminal bent on plunging them into a world of deepening madness.

He also finds his senses quickening and tastes changing as he faces life-threatening 19th-century challenges on and off the baseball diamond. Through his attachments to the ballplayers and the lovely Caitlin O'Neill, he might just regain the sense of family he desperately needs.

That will increasingly become the domain of system administrators. Even for experienced system administrators, X raises many issues, both because of subtle changes in the standard UNIX way of doing things and because X blurs the boundaries between different platforms. Under X, users can run applications across the network on systems with different resources (including fonts, colors, and screen size). Many of these issues are poorly understood, and the technology for dealing with them is in rapid flux.This book is the first and only book devoted to the issues of system administration for X and X-based networks, written not just for UNIX system administrators but for anyone faced with the job of administering X (including those running X on stand-alone workstations). The book includes:An overview of X that focuses on issues that affect the system administrator's job.Information on obtaining, compiling, and installing the X software, including a discussion of the trade-offs between vendor-supplied and the free MIT versions of X.How to set up xdm, the X display manager, which takes the place of the login program under X and can be used to create a customized turnkey X session for each user.How to set up user accounts under X (includes a comparison of the familiar shell setup files and programs to the new mechanisms provided by X).Issues involved in making X more secure.

In Messages from an Owl, Terman not only relates his experiences nursing the starving owlet, \"Stripey,\" back to health and teaching it survival skills in his barn, but also describes the anxiety and elation of letting a companion loose into an uncertain world. Once Terman felt that Stripey knew how to dive after prey, he set the owl free. At this point his story could have ended, with no clue as to what the young bird's fate would be--had it not been for Terman's experimentation with radio tags. By strapping the tags to Stripey, he actually managed to follow the owl into the wild and observe for himself the behavior of a hand-reared individual reunited with its natural environment.Through this unique use of telemetry, Terman tracked Stripey for over six years after the bird left the scientist's barn and took up residence in the surrounding countryside on the Kansas prairie. The radio beacon provided Terman with information on the owl's regular patterns of playing, hunting, exploring, and protecting. It enabled him to witness the moments when Stripey was bantered and mobbed by crows, when other owls launched fierce attacks, and when a prospective mate caught Stripey's eye. On occasional returns to the barn, the owl would follow Terman around as he performed chores, usually waiting for a handout.Until now, scientists have generally believed that an owl nurtured by humans becomes ill-adapted for meeting the challenges of life in the wild. Terman's research proves otherwise. Stripey surpassed all expectations by becoming a totally independent wild creature. With Terman, however, Stripey remained tame, allowing the author to explore something one rarely sees in owls: a warm interest in humanity. Terman engagingly re-creates this dimension of Stripey as he describes with humor and compassion the daily challenges of probing the life of a \"phantom winged tiger.\"Originally published in 1996.The Princeton Legacy Library uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

When did that sudden gap divide your home into territories staked and claimed, with music blasting through the halls and fists banging on doors to turn down the stereo/TV/video game? Teens, when did you start seeing your parents as your enemies instead of your heroes? And parents, when did you start seeing your teens as crazy little demons instead of your loving children?  Finally, there is a solution for both sides, and one that will not only bridge that gap but show parents and teens alike how to prevent it. Jay McGraw is the ideal person to write a book for both parents and teens. A bestselling author by the age of twenty-one and son of number one New York Times bestseller Phillip C. McGraw, Ph.D., known to millions worldwide as Dr. Phil, Jay has seen the parent-teen battle from all angles. In this groundbreaking work, he introduces a new plan for both teens and their parents to work through the issues that divide them and, in the process, rediscover the love that initially defined their relationship.  Jay works from both sides -- sharing the perspectives of parent and teen as the former struggles for control, the latter for independence. He explains to parents how their teenagers wish to be treated, cared for, and even disciplined, and he shows teens how gaining power can come only from earning respect. In this entertaining, informative, and life-changing book, Jay gives instructions to both sides of the familial gap on:  Dos and Don'ts for Parents and Teens Parent and Teen Myths Discovering Your Needs Tuning In to the Needs of Others Ten Ways to Bridge the Gap and Reconnect   In finding a common ground and, even more important, a common respect for each other, parents and teens can break down the walls, unlock the doors, and welcome each other back into one another's lives again.", "publisher": "Touchstone"}, {"id": "468c5981-61ae-4929-9276-4336eed87ee7", "title": "Oracle8i For Dummies (For Dummies Series)", "authors": ["By McCullough-Dieter, Carol and Dana, Ned (FRW)"], "year": "2000", "description": "In Oracle8i For Dummies, Second Edition, author Carol McCullough takes the complexity out of the features available in Oracle8i Release 2 and Enterprise Manager version 2.1.4 and makes them easy to understand.

Eisenhower  The Kennedy White House is the first truly intimate look at Kennedy family life inside the White House. It is an unprecedented visit behind the scenes, revealing the world's most famous family in the world's most famous house. Author Carl Sferrazza Anthony scoured the Kennedy Library archives for never-before-seen color and black-and-white photographs that succeed in illustrating the Kennedy family story -- the joys and tragedies, celebrations and anniversaries, informal family gatherings and escapes to their private homes in Virginia, Palm Beach, Newport, and Hyannis Port. The book also explores for the first time the relationships between Jack and Jackie's nuclear family and both of their extended families.  The 337 full-color and black-and-white photos, taken by the primary White House photographers, are unstaged and provide a far more natural, spontaneous, and realistic portrait of the family than ever before; most of them, including color photographs of each of the private rooms, have never been seen, and they present an unparalleled look at life as it was lived behind the White House doors.  This is also the first book to place the Kennedy family within the context of the culture of the early 1960s and tell the story of the president's personal maturity through his evolving family relationships. Historical events like the Cuban Missile Crisis are uniquely viewed from the family's perspective. An appealing combination of history, biography, and popular culture, The Kennedy White House sheds new light on a family that continues to fascinate the American public forty years after they first captivated our attention.", "publisher": "Touchstone"}, {"id": "e5366771-e2dc-4e10-a07c-d46a577abddd", "title": "Grumbles From The Grave", "authors": ["By Heinlein, Robert A. and Heinlein, Virginia"], "year": "1990", "description": "The popular science fiction writer and author of \"Stranger in a Strange Land\" discusses censorship, the evolution of his style, his virulent atheism, his world travels, bouts with serious illnesses and other topics", "publisher": "Del Rey / Ballantine Books"}, {"id": "76236461-61c7-481a-9ecf-8a1ebba62018", "title": "Ramona Forever (Ramona Series)", "authors": ["By Rogers, Jacqueline (ILT) and Cleary, Beverly"], "year": "2020", "description": "Newbery Medal winner Beverly Cleary continues to amuse readers with her wonderful, blunderful Ramona Quimby!Life can move pretty fastâespecially when you're in the third grade, your teenage sister's moods drive you crazy, and your mom has a suspicious secret she just won't share.

From Hindu mythology to Aztec sacrifices, butterflies have served as a metaphor for resurrection and transformation. Even during World War II, children in a Polish death camp scratched hundreds of butterflies onto the walls of their barracks. But as Russell points out in this rich and lyrical meditation, butterflies are above all objects of obsession. From the beastly horned caterpillar, whose blood helps it count time, to the peacock butterfly, with wings that hiss like a snake, Russell traces the butterflies through their life cycles, exploring the creatures' own obsessions with eating, mating, and migrating. In this way, she reveals the logic behind our endless fascination with butterflies as well as the driving passion of such legendary collectors as the tragic Eleanor Glanville, whose children declared her mad because of her compulsive butterfly collecting, and the brilliant Henry Walter Bates, whose collections from the Amazon in 1858 helped develop his theory of mimicry in nature. Russell also takes us inside some of the world's most prestigious natural history museums, where scientists painstakingly catalogue and categorize new species of Lepidoptera, hoping to shed light on insect genetics and evolution. A luminous journey through an exotic world of obsession and strange beauty, this is a book to be treasured by anyone who's ever watched a butterfly mid-flight and thought, as Russell has, \"I've entered another dimension.\"", "publisher": "Basic Books"}, {"id": "4a0d10d9-6b01-4f6c-8f2c-bea81059e781", "title": "A Samba for Sherlock", "authors": ["By Soares, Jo and Landers, Clifford E. (TRN)"], "year": "1997", "description": "Set in Rio de Janeiro in 1886, this internationally acclaimed literary thriller begins with the theft of a Stradivarius violin that has been presented by His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil to one of his more delectable mistresses--a harmless crime in itself but one that mystifies the authorities and (far more important) embarrasses the Emperor.  At the suggestion of Sarah Bernhardt, who is on a triumphant tour through South America, the great Sherlock Holmes is summoned from London to solve the case. But by the time he arrives, events have taken a turn for the worse, as a series of grisly murders shocks the city--the victims all beautiful young women. In each case, the killer leaves his calling card: a violin string entangled in the woman's pubic hair, the corpse stripped of a flap of skin.Holmes (and Dr. Watson, of course) are immediately off on the track of the killer, but although Sherlock succeeds in coining the term \"serial killer,\"  his celebrated powers of deduction don't get him very far with the case itself: overcome by the charm of the tropics, some spectacular digestive difficulties, and the strong appeal of a pretty young actress--at thirty-two, he's not exactly a sexual virtuoso--Sherlock finds himself in a thicker fog than he ever encountered back home in London. And in dark counterpoint to Holmes's questionable ratiocinations and the novel's brilliantly re-created texture of nineteenth-century literary, social, and low-life Rio, is the chilling yet hypnotic voice of the killer himself, a monster of intelligence, evil, and ever-spreading fame. . . .A Samba for Sherlock is the work of a mind of encyclopedic knowledge, caustic wit, brilliant style, and, above all, a formidable ability to entertain.", "publisher": "Pantheon"}, {"id": "4a0cfb9d-75d5-40b1-99b3-2ec1fa34ba01", "title": "If the Gods Had Meant Us to Vote They Would Have Given Us Candidates", "authors": ["By Hightower, Jim"], "year": "2000", "description": "If anything, in this presidential election special, he's madder than ever!In his earlier bestseller, There's Nothing in the Middle of the Road but Yellow Stripes and Dead Armadillos, Hightower only began to tap into the deep yearning that Americans have for a new politics that speaks to them from a real-world, kitchen-table perspective. Now, with the year 2000 being an especially significant marker for contemplating our country's direction, not only for the new year but for the new century and the new millennium, it's time for citizens to reclaim their political, economic, and cultural heritage.Leading the way with his hilariously irreverent yet profoundly serious book is our name-naming, podium-pounding, point-them-in-the-right-direction populist, Hightower himself. He whacks conventional wisdom right upside the head,showing,with startling facts and compelling personal stories, that despite a so-called period of prosperity, America's middle class is getting mugged, and that far from being ordained by the gods,globalization is globaloney! Hightower rips the mass off of the candidates, the parties, the consultants, and especially the moneyed powers whoa re supporting all of the leading presidential hopefuls. he's mad about them all--but what he's maddest about, what really gets his goat,is that they are all the same! To paraphrase Jim, American politicians are alike because they don't come cheap. In fact, they're all very expansive. which is why only the rich can own them and why their allegiance is definitely not to regular,worka-day citizens.No one is spared in this insightful and engaging blend of horror and success stories, hard-hitting commentary, laugh-out-loud humor, useful facts, and sparkling language. An equal opportunity muckraker and conscientious agitator for \"We the people,\" Hightower inspires us to take charge again, to build a new politics, and, together, to build a better tomorrow.

Opulence and artistic brilliance blended with images of suffering on a monumental scale make up the historic persona of the late W. Bruce Lincoln's lavish \"biography\" of this mysterious, complex city. Climate and comfort were not what Tsar Peter the Great had in mind when, in the spring of 1703, he decided to build a new capital in the muddy marshes of the Neva River delta. Located 500 miles below the Arctic Circle, this area, with its foul weather, bad water, and sodden soil, was so unattractive that only a handful of Finnish fisherman had ever settled there. Bathed in sunlight at midnight in the summer, it brooded in darkness at noon in the winter, and its canals froze solid at least five months out of every year. Yet to the Tsar, the place he named Sankt Pieter Burkh had the makings of a \"paradise.\" His vision was soon borne out: though St. Petersburg was closer to London, Paris, and Vienna than to Russia's far-off eastern lands, it quickly became the political, cultural, and economic center of an empire that stretched across more than a dozen time zones and over three continents.

Peter Steinfels shows how even before the recent revelations about sexual abuse by priests, the explosive combination of generational change and the thinning ranks of priests and nuns was creating a grave crisis of leadership and identity.    This groundbreaking book offers an analysis not just of the church's immediate troubles but of less visible, more powerful forces working below the surface of an institution that provides a spiritual identity for 65 million Americans and spans the nation with its parishes, schools, colleges and universities, hospitals, clinics, and social service agencies.  In A People Adrift, Steinfels warns that entrenched liberals and conservatives are trapped in a \"theo-logical gridlock\" that often ignores what in fact goes on in families, parishes, classrooms, voting booths, and Catholic organizations of all types. Above all, he insists, the altered Catholic landscape demands a new agenda for leadership, from the selection of bishops and the rethinking of the priesthood to the thorough preparation and genuine incorporation of a lay leadership that is already taking over key responsibilities in Catholic institutions.

Set in Pyke County, Mississippi, Eden is a raw, heartbreaking, and enlightening novel that marks the emergence of a stunning and original talent. Narrated by fourteen-year-old Maddy Dangerfield, Eden opens in the moments after Maddy has impulsively drawn a naked woman on the pages of Genesis in bright red lipstick during Sunday service. The community is scandalized, and her devout, long-suffering motherâs response to her transgression is to force her to spend weekends nursing her dying Aunt Pip, an outcast who lives on the edge of town.From then on, Maddy must negotiate her two worlds: at the house where she lives with her hard-working, Bible-reading mother, Faye, and her father, Chevrolet?a one-armed drunk, gambler and womanizer?she is both a reluctant participant in and astute observer of the strange and confounding dynamics of her sometimes violent, sometimes tender family. (Years before, Maddyâs grandmother?her motherâs mother?chopped of Chevroletâs arm and fed it to the pigs after he and Pip were found together in the back room as Faye entertained friends from the church?and ever since, he has been am emasculated, desperate man?drinking and gambling his wifeâs money away, leaving her to clean up his mess time and again.) And then out on Commitment Road, she is caretaker to her Aunt Pip, whose only friend is her eccentric neighbor, Fat. Maddyâs time with Pip and Fat opens her eyes to the exhilaration of speaking your own mind, living your life on your own terms and without apology, and also to the cost extracted by both. She learns that there are strengths that belong to women alone, and also that there is a kind of ravaging vulnerability that is terrifying and inescapable, and uniquely female.The world Maddy inherits is one of injustice and hypocrisy, one that requires black people work for the whites for little to no pay; that sent her Uncle Sugar to jail for raping a white woman?no questions asked?when Maddy was just a baby; that preaches Christian love and forgiveness even as its actions reflect the very opposite. But Maddy soon learns that there is something that can work to oppose those truths, and that is knowledge; having the will and the ability to look beneath the surface, to question what others take as a given. By the end of the novel, newly acquainted with mortality and her own fierce strength, Maddy comes to bear both the burden and the blessing of that knowledge.In lush, vivid brushstrokes, Olympia Vernon conjures a world that is both intoxicating and cruel, and illuminates the bittersweet transformation of the young girl who must bear the burden and blessing of its secrets too soon. Eden is a haunting, memorable novel propelled by the poetry and power of a voice that is complex, lyrical, and utterly true.", "publisher": "Grove Press"}, {"id": "98927848-122b-4183-bec9-d426bc66e0a3", "title": "Joe Egg", "authors": ["By Nichols, Peter"], "year": "1994", "description": "This brilliantly written, deeply moving play about the problems of a young couple with a spastic daughter-the \"Joe Egg\" of the title-was described by Ronald Bryden in The Observer (London) as a \"remarkable play about a nightmare all women must have dreamed at some time, and most men: living with a child born so hopelessly crippled as to be, as the father in it says brutally, a human parsnip.

This saga of Sen. David L. Boren's seven-year struggle to overcome Congressional self-interest and reach a bipartisan consensus demonstrates the power of moneyed interests that gridlocks government and stifles political competition.These efforts at campaign finance reform took shape in 1985, but not until 1987 - when Democrats regained control of the Senate - was Senator Boren's legislation taken seriously. In 1988, following a dramatic fifty-seven-hour session, a record-breaking cloture vote failed, and the money chase continued. Next the Senate and the House pushed to pass separate bills, but that effort failed as the Congress rushed to adjourn. Soon after the 1990 elections, the White House promised to kill the campaign finance reform bill. And just eleven days before a 1992 fundraising dinner at which donors paid $92,000 to be photographed with the president, the legislation was vetoed.In vivid detail The Gilded Dome describes negotiations to produce the most wide-ranging reform of campaign law since Watergate. In addition to describing efforts within Congress, the author explains how others - the media, lobbyists, and party officials - play the game and affect the legislative process. Kubiak concludes that the power of money in politics and the power of people in government must be balanced. Only then will the gilded dome, which conceals the power of money and special interests, reflect the beauty of our democracy.", "publisher": "Univ of Oklahoma Pr"}, {"id": "d2f973fd-3c55-4949-8468-98aa57a63662", "title": "Mediterranean Flavors: Recipes from the Countries of the Sun", "authors": ["By Wormell, Christopher (ILT) and Sevilla, Maria Jose"], "year": "1995", "description": "A collection of traditional Mediterranean recipes features bread, pasta, eggplant, fish, lamb, spices, and wine", "publisher": "Clarkson Potter"}, {"id": "2de3044a-864c-49d2-be0c-6400606f1c28", "title": "The Last Days of Haute Cuisine: The Coming of Age of American Restaurants", "authors": ["By Kuh, Patric"], "year": "2002", "description": "Combining an insider's passion with down-to-earth humor, chef and food writer Patric Kuh traces the evolution of American high-style restaurants from the 1941 opening of Le Pavillon to the recent rise of less traditional restaurants, such as Le Cirque, Spago, and Danny Meyer's Union Square group.

While there, he is charged by God, his Heavenly Father - attired in black dragon robe and high-brimmed hat, his mouth almost hidden by his luxuriant golden beard - to slay the demon devils who are leading the people on earth astray. Their leader is Yan Luo, king of hell, the Dragon Demon of the Eastern Sea. Hong does battle in Heaven, armed by his father with sword and seal, aided by his elder brother, Jesus. Returned to his home village in south China, he resolves to carry on the struggle against the evil polluting humanity. He knows himself to be the younger brother of Jesus Christ, God's Chinese son.The Taiping uprising, led by Hong Xiuquan, was a massive millennial movement that, in its violent rise and fall between 1845 and 1864, cost at least twenty million Chinese their lives. In the course of this struggle the Taiping succeeded in overturning the authority of the ruling Qing dynasty throughout a massive territory in southern China. This the Taiping ruled as their Heavenly Kingdom from their seat in Nanjing for eleven years, until they were overcome in an apocalypse wrought by Qing and Western forces, the Book of Revelation become history.In this master work of the historian's art, Jonathan Spence creates a history of intimate detail and grand scale. We enter the fevered dream world of Hong Xiuquan as he meets his Heavenly family; we see the torments awaiting earthly sinners in King Yan Luo's hell; we feel the anxieties of Westerners living circumscribed lives on the edges of a China they do not understand. This is a China of vast instability, ruled by a dynasty in decline, beset by pirates and bandits in areas beyond the government's reach, pressed by Western traders to embrace opium, Western missionaries the word of God, and arms dealers the new weapons of the industrial revolution. Hong's movement ignites this volatile situation, and Spence captures the result on a breathtaking canvas of clashing armies, daring strategic thrusts, and protracted, deadly sieges.

It has been years since their paths crossed, and in that time Thomas has become a kind of literary legend. His renown is enhanced by his elusiveness; for most of the past decade, he has remained in seclusion following a devastating loss.This is no chance meeting. Thomas learned that Linda was reading at the festival and chose this moment to reestablish contact with a woman he passionately pursued years earlier. Their affair was disastrous, and a turning point in both their lives. Neither the intensity of their relationship nor the damage it did has ever been far from his memory.From the moment they speak, The Last Time They Met unfolds the story of Linda and Thomas in an extraordinary way: it travels back into their past, bypassing layers of memory and interpretation to present their earlier encounters with unshakable immediacy. In Africa, when Linda and Thomas were twenty-seven, and in Massachusetts, when they were in high school, the novel re-creates love at its exhilirating pinnacle - the kind of intense connection that becomes the true north against which all relationships are measured.Moving backward through time, The Last Time They Met traces the shocking resonance a single choice, even a single word, can have over the course of a lifetime. At the same time, the novel creates an almost unbearable mystery, a mystery that can be understood fully only in the novel's final pages, in the eyes of young Linda Fallon and the young man who loves her.", "publisher": "Little, Brown and Company"}, {"id": "1ae6983c-10e9-4036-a9e3-947c7172e686", "title": "How to Talk So People Listen: The Real Key to Job Success", "authors": ["By Hamlin, Sonya"], "year": "1989", "description": "Whether making a presentation or dealing one on one, interacting at a meeting or just answering questions, do others listen when you talk?

What to Expect When You're Expecting is a perennial New York Times bestseller and one of USA Today's 25 most influential books of the past 25 years. It's read by more than 90% of pregnant women who read a pregnancy bookâthe most iconic, must-have book for parents-to-be, with over 14.5 million copies in print. Now comes the Fourth Edition, a new book for a new generation of expectant momsâfeaturing a new look, a fresh perspective, and a friendlier-than-ever voice. It's filled with the most up-to-date information reflecting not only what's new in pregnancy, but what's relevant to pregnant women. Heidi Murkoff has rewritten every section of the book, answering dozens of new questions and including loads of new asked-for material, such as a detailed week-by-week fetal development section in each of the monthly chapters, an expanded chapter on pre-conception, and a brand new one on carrying multiples. More comprehensive, reassuring, and empathetic than ever, the Fourth Edition incorporates the most recent developments in obstetrics and addresses the most current lifestyle trends (from tattooing and belly piercing to Botox and aromatherapy). There's more than ever on pregnancy matters practical (including an expanded section on workplace concerns), physical (with more symptoms, more solutions), emotional (more advice on riding the mood roller coaster), nutritional (from low-carb to vegan, from junk foodâdependent to caffeine-addicted), and sexual (what's hot and what's not in pregnant lovemaking), as well as much more support for that very important partner in parenting, the dad-to-be.

As a brown man, I think . . .  (But do we really think that color colors thought?)  In his two previous memoirs, Hunger of Memory and Days of Obligation, Rodriguez wrote about the intersection of his private life with public issues of class and ethnicity. With Brown, his consideration of race, Rodriguez completes his \"trilogy on American public life.\"  For Rodriguez, brown is not a singular color. Brown is evidence of mixture. Brown is a shade created by desire-an emblem of the erotic history of America, which began the moment the African and the European met within the Indian eye. Rodriguez reflects on various cultural associations of the color brown-toil, decay, impurity, time-arranging dazzling juxtapositions for which he is justly famous: Alexis de Tocqueville, Malcolm X, minstrel shows, Broadway musicals, Puritanism, the Sistine Chapel, Cubism, homosexuality, and the influence on his life of two federal figures-Ben Franklin and Richard Nixon (\"the dark father of Hispanicity\").  At the core of the book is an assessment of the meaning of Hispanics to the life of America. Reflecting upon the new demographic profile of our country, Rodriguez observes that Hispanics are becoming Americanized at the same rate that the United States is becoming Latinized.

But it was only when, at age sixty-one, he happened upon a trapeze training program at the San Francisco School of Circus Arts that he took up the quest in earnest. After ascending to the platform thirty-one feet in the air and grasping the trapeze bar, Keen dove into the ocean of emptiness above the net, lost in the pleasure of swinging. Returning to the trapeze again and again, he gradually developed the poise and confidence that allowed him to release himself from the bar and soar--airborne--into the hands of a catcher. Having tasted the elation of actual flight, Keen's childhood dream became a passion and a vehicle for exploring the challenges and dilemmas of life.In Learning to Fly, Keen traces the life journey that led him to respond to the lure of the trapeze late in his life and shares what his five years of intensive practice have taught him about living more intensely and passionately. He also recounts how his recognition of this art form's transcendent powers led him to launch Upward Bound, a trapeze workshop for anyone facing deeply rooted fears.An unprecedented adventure of the soul and psyche, Learning to Fly teaches us to soar on the wings of possibility as we watch Keen and his students progress through breathtaking exercises. As he describes take-offs and knee hangs and thrilling mid-air catches, Keen imparts moving revelations about risk-taking, trust, bravado, true strength, falling, and letting go.

Ward provides a gripping journey through the turbulent history of the region that has come to symbolize America around the world. Drawing upon hundreds of letters, diaries, memoirs, and journals as well as the latest scholarship. The West chronicles the arrival of wave after wave of newcomers from every direction of the compass, each of which invested the harsh but majestic western landscape with its own myths and desires and dreams.The cast is as rich and diverse as the western landscape itself - explorers and soldiers and Indian warriors, settlers and railroad builders and gaudy showmen. Coronado and Custer, Jesse James and Chief Joseph and Brigham Young and Buffalo Bill are all here. But so are scores of lesser-known westerners whose stories are no less compelling - a Chinese ditchdiggger and a rich Mexican landowner, a forty-niner from Chile and a Texas cowboy born in Britain, a woman missionary to the Indians who loathed the West and a Wellesley graduate who loved it in spite of everything it did to her and her family.The West explores the tensions between whites and the native peoples they sought to displace, but it also encompasses the Hispanic experience in the West, from the time of the conquistadors to the transformation of a Mexican-American village called Los Angeles into the region's major metropolis; the lives of Chinese immigrants who called the region \"Gold Mountain\"; and the ordeals of freed slaves from the South who sought a better life homesteading on the Great Plains.With essays by distinguished historians and writers about the West: Dayton Duncan, John Mack Faragher, David G.

This blanced and highly successful collaboration of scholars with a theater director solves the contemporary problems of translating and staging the Orestia, which originally was written to be performed in Athens in the first half of the fifth century B.C.Â While remaning faithful to the original Greek, Grene and O'Flaherty embrace a strong and adventurous English style, vivid and visceral. The language of this extraordinary translation, immediately accessible to a theater audience, speaks across the centuries. Premiered at Chicago's Court Theater in 1986 under Rudall's direction, the stage adaptation of the Orestia proved eminently playable. Â This new adaptation of the orestia offers a brilliant demonstration of how clearly defined goals (here, the actor's needs) can inspire translators to produce fresh, genuine, accessible dramatic texts. The resulting work provides complete and accurate texts for those who cannot read the original Greek, and it transforms the Orestia into an effective modern stage play. With interpretive introductions written by the translators and director, this new version will be welcomed by teachers of translation courses, by students of Greek and world drama in general, and by theater professionals.", "publisher": "University of Chicago Press"}, {"id": "61e75714-0f08-4c9a-9f7b-11d5536b769f", "title": "The Essential Marathoner", "authors": ["By Hanc, John and Waitz, Greta (FRW)"], "year": "1996", "description": "A sensible guide to training to go the distance.", "publisher": "Lyons Press"}, {"id": "91be5e4a-d89d-4a3f-899f-faf9d336a1d8", "title": "Automobiles (History Series)", "authors": ["By Corbett, David"], "year": "1999", "description": "Explores the evolution of the automobile, from the fourteenth century plans of Guido da Vigevano to the Thrust SSC, which broke the sound barrier in the late twentieth century.", "publisher": "Barrons Juveniles"}, {"id": "3830deae-422b-4c02-9726-bbbc9ff473d9", "title": "Drover and the Designated Hitter (Drover, No 3)", "authors": ["By Granger, Bill"], "year": "1994", "description": "Ex-sportswriter Jimmy Drover is a cross between Breslin and Bogart: the contemporary hard-bitten tough guy in his purest form.

They weren't doing business; Drover was just catching up with some guys he knew from growing up in the streets. But a U.S. attorney with ulterior motives got him fired from his paper, and Drover's life was upended.Now he lives in Santa Cruz, trading stories and killing time at a local bar with a crew of good-natured, trustworthy lazybones. To make ends meet, he works off and on for Fox Vernon, a legendary Las Vegas oddsmaker. Vernon needs a scout, a busybody - and so Drover makes a living by using his intuitions and sports world knowledge, talking his way into locker rooms, gambling dens, mobsters' and managers' offices, traveling around the country in pursuit of sports world info that might affect the odds on Sunday's game.Drover is called into an investigation of Homer White, whose heavy-hitting baseball career with the Chicago Cubs has gone into a slump after leg injuries. Homer's suspected of gambling - easy enough for Drover to check up on, given his above- and below-board contacts. But as Drover gets more of the lowdown, the picture becomes more deadly: Some people want to sabotage Homer's career - including his bitter ex-wife. Some want to save it - including his beautiful rehab nurse, Helen Brown. Trying to learn the hidden story, Drover steps into a knotty web of threats and violent passions and finds himself again under suspicion - and under the gun.The third in Bill Granger's best-selling Drover series, Drover and the Designated Hitter comes through again with Granger's vivid panorama of modern sports world detail and Drover's caustic, seen-it-all wit.", "publisher": "William Morrow & Co"}, {"id": "e76e7c2f-a67a-46fe-9228-f225c0624036", "title": "Royal Survivor: The Life of Charles II", "authors": ["By Coote, Stephen"], "year": "2000", "description": "Presents the former king of England as a wily, manipulative, and cynical politician.

The action begins at midnight, June 5/6, when the first British and American airborne troops jumped into France. It ends at midnight June 6/7.

So did philosophers of old. Now, modern science and new research are helping us to understand these connections. In Healing and the Mind, Bill Moyers talks with physicians, scientists, therapists, and patients - people who are taking a new look at the meaning of sickness and health. In a series of fascinating and provocative interviews, he discusses their search for answers to perplexing questions: How do emotions translate into chemicals in our bodies? How do thoughts and feelings influence health? How can we collaborate with our bodies to encourage healing?Healing and the Mind travels from small private clinics to large public hospitals to examine how advances in mind/body medicine are being applied on a day-to-day level in the hurried and technology-driven world of modern medicine. From neonatal care to geriatrics, from day surgery to the treatment of chronic illness, medical professionals are finding that when they practice the \"new medicine,\" their patients heal faster, leave the hospital sooner, and do better once they get home.Bill Moyers and David Grubin also travel to the People's Republic of China. There they explore the implications of that country's fusion of Western practices with traditional Chinese medicine, including acupuncture, massage, herbal potions, and the mysterious concept called chi. They take an intimate look at alternate therapy programs, including a Massachusetts medical center that combines Eastern meditation with Western therapy in the treatment of ailments as diverse as hypertension and chronic back pain. And they visit a California retreat where cancer patients help each other discover that healing can occur even when a cure is impossible.With the incisive style that has made Bill Moyers's skills as an interviewer legendary, and the dynamic interplay of text and art that has made his previous books international bestsellers, Healing and the Mind is a landmark work, destined to influence how America thinks about sickness and health.", "publisher": "Doubleday"}, {"id": "e3eac341-6ff1-4e33-ab87-34c48e857fcd", "title": "Presences: A Bishop's Life in the City", "authors": ["By Moore, Paul"], "year": "1997", "description": "A intimate reminiscence details the former Episcopal Bishop of New York's service in World War II, his calling to the ministry, his creation of a new form of urban ministry, his opening of the Episcopal clergy to women and gay people, and many other accomplishments that detail his devotion to God, his family, and the people he helps.", "publisher": "Farrar Straus & Giroux"}, {"id": "6cd4227d-dcc1-4e49-bc99-4f47fef22f8f", "title": "The Mission: Inside the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints", "authors": ["By Naythons, Matthew"], "year": "1995", "description": "The Mission is an extraordinary look by a team of international photojournalists at the customs, culture and spirit of the people of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, commonly known as the Mormons.Over the course of a year, fifty of the world's most talented photographers journeyed to six continents and were given unprecedented access to Church members.

Although all were alarmed by the rapid destruction of game species in the late 1800s, some sought to preserve animals for their aesthetic and material benefit to humans, while others believed it was wrong to mistreat any wild creature.  Wild Animals and American Environmental Ethics shows how the latter view evolved into the animal rights activism of today.  Lisa Mighetto examines portrayals of wildlife in popular literature dating from the nineteenth century, revealing how early conservationists looked for evidence of morality in animals that would make them more acceptable to the American public.  Arguing that animals should be protected because they think, feel, and act in a manner similar to humans, some went so far as to claim that these creatures have rights.    Not all wild animals readily conformed to the new image.  The first conservationists did not extend their ethics to predators or \"varmints,\" and supported government efforts to wipe them out.  By describing how animal lovers gradually came to advocate protection of even these creatures, Mighetto traces the development of modern ecological values and the biocentric perspective.  Americans now stand at a critical point in wildlife protection, wielding the threat of extinction over numerous species.  Mighetto places arguments regarding wildlife protection in historical perspective and thus helps us evaluate our inherited attitudes and assumptions about the animal world.  Enhancing the text are more than fifty illustrations that demonstrate the interaction between humans and wildlife over the last century.", "publisher": "University of Arizona Press"}, {"id": "8cd7558c-fb4d-4556-b66f-43b8343dbb74", "title": "What Every Mom Needs", "authors": ["By Morgan, Elisa and Kuykendall, Carol"], "year": "1998", "description": "'When will I ever get time for myself?

The Bundy brothers embodied all the idealism and hubris that animated American foreign policy in the decades after World War II. They will be remembered forever as anti-communist liberals who, despite their grave doubts about sending Americans to fight in Southeast Asia, became key architects of America's war in Vietnam.  Kai Bird, the author of The Chairman, the acclaimed biography of John J. McCloy, brilliantly recreates the world of Boston Brahmin privilege in which the Bundy brothers were reared to govern. Educated at Groton, Yale and Harvard, Mac and Bill Bundy were protÃ©gÃ©s of Henry Stimson, Dean Acheson and Justice Felix Frankfurter, and their friends and admirers included Walter Lippmann, Joseph Alsop and J. Robert Oppenheimer. Bill played a major role in the supersecret ULTRA code-breaking project that proved invaluable to the Allies' victory over Nazi Germany. Mac, a key military aide, was present at D-day and later wrote Stimson's influential but misleading essay explaining Truman's decision to use the atomic bomb.  In the 1950s, both brothers became ensnared in Senator Joseph McCarthy's witchhunts against suspected communists in government and academia. As dean of Harvard College, Mac fought to protect his tenured faculty while sacrificing junior scholars who refused to \"name names\" to the FBI. Bill, a high-ranking CIA official, saw his career nearly destroyed when McCarthy learned he had contributed money to Alger Hiss's defense fund. Bill's refusal to testify before the senator's committee was a turning point in the battle against McCarthyism.  The brothers reached the apex of the national security establishment under Presidents Kennedy and Johnson. Kennedy appointed Mac Bundy to be his national security adviser, and Bill Bundy moved into senior positions at the Pentagon and the State Department. One or the other was involved in many of the triumphs and deceits of the Kennedy years, including the Bay of Pigs fiasco, plots to eliminate Fidel Castro and the Cuban Missile Crisis. But it was their role in guiding the nation to war in Vietnam that engulfed them in controversy and indelibly marked them as failed figures in American history.  At every stage of the war -- from the assassination of South Vietnamese president Diem in 1963 to the Gulf of Tonkin incident in 1964, from the bombing campaign of Operation Rolling Thunder to President Johnson's July 1965 decision to send hundreds of thousands of U.S. combat troops to Vietnam -- the Bundy brothers were present, urging a policy of gradual escalation. Long after Johnson had dismissed their warning that Vietnam could become a \"white man's war\" on the Asian mainland, the Bundys remained loyal to their liberal president, who was determined not to allow right-wing critics to accuse him of losing another Asian country to communism. Even after Mac left the government in 1966 to become the controversial president of the Ford Foundation, he remained silent on the war. Bill stayed on in Washington until 1969, prosecuting a war he knew was unwinnable.  Based on nearly a hundred interviews with the Bundy brothers, their families and colleagues, and on thousands of pages of archival documents -- including some White House memos that remain classified -- Bird's account contains dramatic new information that alters the history of the Vietnam War.

Brennan, Jr. sat for thirty-four years on the United States Supreme Court. Throughout his tenure on the Court he meticulously examined the body of Constitutional law - and effectively resuscitated its spirit. A champion of minorities and a spokesman for the politically dispossessed, he passionately defended civil rights and strove to bring the nation's disenfranchised into the mainstream of American life. He advanced the political empowerment of American cities and suburbs. He essentially wrote the modern law of freedom of speech and the press.Justice Brennan's retirement in 1990 occasioned tributes from a host of associates, former law clerks, attorneys, judges, professors, journalists, and friends. The reflections on Brennan in Part I of this volume provide intimate, often humorous glimpses into a generous, warm, open-hearted man who also happened to be an intellectual giant and outstanding jurist.In Part II the jurisprudence of Justice Brennan is comprehensively surveyed and lucidly discussed by author and Constitutional law professor Roger Goldman. With care he examines - and in layman's terms explains - Brennan's positions on the issues central to the justice's career: the First Amendment, the Fourteenth Amendment, civil rights, education, abortion, obscenity, and capital punishment.Eloquent, persuasive, and faithful to his vision, Justice Brennan authored more than a thousand opinions, concurrences, and dissents in the course of his judicial career. Part III of the book offers twelve landmark decisions written by Brennan that show clearly why history will place him beside John Marshall, Louis Brandeis, and Oliver Wendell Holmes as one of the truly great justices in the annals of the United States Supreme Court.", "publisher": "Carroll & Graf Pub"}, {"id": "f52873cf-1903-46c3-8ede-f2365fde6cc8", "title": "Date Him or Dump Him?: The No-Nonsense Relationship Quiz", "authors": ["By Heckscher, Melissa and Termine, Athony, M.D. (FRW)"], "year": "2005", "description": "Is he still in love with his ex?

John Paul II has systematically addressed every major question on the world's agenda at the turn of the millennium: the human yearning for the sacred, the meaning of freedom, the glories and challenges of human sexuality, the promise of the women's movement, the quest for a new world order, the nature of good and evil, the moral challenge of prosperity, and the imperative of human solidarity in the emerging global civilization.By bringing the age-old wisdom of biblical religion into active conversation with contemporary life and thought, the Pope \"from a far country\" has crafted a challenging proposal for the human future that is without parallel in the modern world.  Weigel explores new information about the Pope's role in some of the recent past's most stirring events, including the fall of communism; the Vatican/Israel negotiation of 1991-92; the collapse of the Philippine, Chilean, Nicaraguan, and Paraguayan dictatorships during the 1980s; and the epic papal visit to Cuba. Weigel also includes previously unpublished papal correspondence with Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Deng Xiaoping, and draws on hitherto unavailable autobiographical reminiscences by the Pope.  Witness to Hope also discusses the Pope's efforts to build bridges to other Christian communities, and to Judaism, Islam, and other great world religions; presents an analysis of John Paul's proposals for strengthening democratic societies in the twenty-first century; and offers synopses of every major teaching document in the pontificate.  Rounding out the dramatic story of Pope John Paul II are fresh translations of his poetry; detailed personal anecdotes of the Pope as a young man, priest, and friend, sketched by those who knew him best; and in-depth interviews with Catholic leaders throughout the world.  A magisterial biography of one of the most important figures -- some might argue, the most important figure -- of the twentieth century, Witness to Hope is an extraordinary testimony to the man and his accomplishments, and a papal biography unlike any other.", "publisher": "Harper Perennial"}, {"id": "146274cf-c545-4e03-93db-65835555833a", "title": "Six Wives: The Queens of Henry VIII", "authors": ["By Starkey, David"], "year": "2004", "description": "No one in history had a more eventful career in matrimony than Henry VIII. His marriages were daring and tumultuous, and made instant legends of six very different women. In this remarkable study, David Starkey argues that the king was not a depraved philanderer but someone seeking happiness -- and a son. Knowingly or not, he elevateda group of women to extraordinary heights and changed the way a nation was governed.Six Wives is a masterful work of history that intimately examines the rituals of diplomacy, marriage, pregnancy, and religion that were part of daily life for women at the Tudor Court. Weaving new facts and fresh interpretations into a spellbinding account of the emotional drama surrounding Henry's six marriages, David Starkey reveals the central role that the queens played in determining policy.

Dell, then an incoming freshman at the University of Texas at Austin, drove away from his parents' Houston home in a white BMW  he'd bought selling subscriptions to his hometown newspaper. In the backseat were three personal computers.  Today, he is the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Dell Computer Corporation, an $18 billion company, the second-largest manufacturer and marketer of computers in the world. Founded on a deceptively simple premise--to deliver high-performance computer systems directly to the end user--Dell Computer is the envy of its competition, constantly growing at five  times the industry rate, and a perennial darling of Wall Street: its stock is up more than 36,000 percent this decade, and more than 200 percent in the last year.  In  Direct From Dell, Michael Dell himself tells the incredible story of Dell Computer's successful rise, beginning in his college dorm room with $1,000 in capital.  In these pages, you'll see the formation of a great visionary--and a great company. You'll meet the young Dell who, at the tender age of eight, had already begun looking \"to eliminate unnecessary steps\" and who, as a numbers-loving adolescent, was inspired by a newfound fascination with computers to save his money to buy a coveted Apple II--only to promptly take it apart. You'll encounter a young visionary who, upon witnessing  the inefficiencies of an exploding industry, challenged conventional wisdom and set out to do nothing less than  beat IBM at its own game. In so doing, Dell forever changed the way things \"had always been done\" in the computer industry.  You'll also see the birth of a Dell  hallmark--the direct model--which, in its ability to reach the customer directly, eliminated not only a substantial middleman markup but also the possibility of costly excess inventory, setting the stage for other extraordinary achievements. In an industry notorious for its unreliable service, Dell utilized its direct customer relationships to pioneer the concept of customer \"support\"--and didn't rest until the caliber of its service was rivaled only by the quality of its products and its speed of delivery.  But the story of Dell Computer is no fairy tale. Marked by uncharacteristically rapid growth, the company was faced with challenges that could have threatened its very existence. From forays into retail to under- (and over-) developed product lines, Dell learned some hard lessons along the way--and emerged stronger as a result.  The strategies born of those times--unrivaled speed to market; superior customer service; a fierce commitment to producing  constantly high-quality custom-made systems--heralded what has perhaps been the company's crowning achievement: an early exploitation of the Internet. One of the first companies to actually make money online, Dell is now selling more than $12 million worth of systems per day over www.dell.com.  Not just for CEOs or those in high tech, the strategies revealed in Direct From Dell are invaluable to managers in a broad cross section of industries. From starting a successful business to pioneering computer sales and service over the Internet, Dell shares his perspectives on:  Why it's infinitely better for any business starting out to have too little capital, rather than too much  How studying your customers--not your competition--will give you a greater competitive edge  Why it can be life-threatening to your company to pursue too many good ideas--or to grow too fast  Why it's essential to run a P&L on every area of your business  Why your people prose a greater threat to the health of your business than your competition does  How you can exploit your competition's weakness by exposing its greatest strength  How integrating your business virtually can make the difference between being quick--and being dead  Revealing nothing less than a new model for doing business in the information age, Direct From Dell is both an extraordinary business success story and a manifesto for revolutionizing any industry.", "publisher": "Harper Business"}, {"id": "73d260eb-641d-41d9-b8a4-e3c0cca35303", "title": "Do Penguins Have Knees?

But its legend survives in the masterful masonry of its paving blocks and the ruined glory of ghost cities such as Cuzco. In this vivid, free-wheeling expedition, Karin Muller travels the ancient route to explore its dramatic history and discover new adventures along its length and breadth.  Along the Inca Road shares the stillness of sunrise in the haunted aerie of Machu Picchu, clings to the roof of a rattletrap bus skirting the vertiginous precipices of the Andes, carouses through the streets of an Altiplano city on Carnival, and inches warily forward as Ecuadorian soldiers probe for land mines with bayonets. Muller's ready for just about anything, whether it's challenging the Pacific surf in a traditional Inca reed boat, locking horns with a bull in a cheering Peruvian arena, or joining a crack Bolivian anti-narcotics team on a hunt for clandestine cocaine labs deep in the jungle. She initiates us into the mysteries of the spirits at a shaman's rite involving hamsters, hallucinogens, and copious libations of moonshine, and high in a mountain meadow captures a struggling vicuna, whose prized silky fleece once was reserved for the Inca god-king alone. And these are only a few of the traveler's tales from a 3,125-mile odyssey encompassing four countries and every form of transportation under the sun, from footslogging, mule train, and motorbike to state-of-the-art military vehicles.  As she spins the wool of her stories into a modern tapestry of faces and memories, Muller intertwines a chronicle of the ancient Inca from their race's mythical birth on an island in lofty Lake Titicaca to their sudden plunge from the height of imperial power at the hands of a ragtag band of Spanish soldiers of fortune. We learn how they lived, worshipped, and warred, and why such a magnificent culture proved so vulnerable to invaders.  As spectacular as the mountainscapes that are its breathtaking backdrop, Along the Inca Road is a wonderful panorama of past and present -- the kind of sharply observed portrait of a unique part of the world and its colorful people that displays the art of travel literature at its best.", "publisher": "National Geographic"}, {"id": "fd191d29-7b08-4cee-b7df-860123fdbcfe", "title": "Follow This Path: How the World's Greatest Organizations Drive Growth by Unleashing Human Potential", "authors": ["By Coffman, Curt and Gonzalez-Molina, Gabriel"], "year": "2002", "description": "When it comes to getting ahead in business, The Gallup Organization has led the way with two landmark books: the New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestsellers First, Break All the Rules and Now, Discover Your Strengths.
